<dt class="keepwithnext">52-190 BXA Freshman Interdisciplinary Seminar</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The BXA Freshman Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces first-year students to the field of interdisciplinary work and arts-based research. Students engage with theoretical and practical readings from across the various concentrations, with particular emphasis on aesthetic theory. Guest lectures complement the weekly readings by giving insight into practical implementations of these ideas. Students will conceive, research, and create a final project to be presented at the end of the semester. BXA internal transfer students should register for <a href="/search/?P=52-399" title="52-399" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '52-399');">52-399</a> BXA Interdisciplinary Seminar to fulfill the interdisciplinary requirement.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">52-290 Literacy Across Disciplines</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 5 units<br />One of the central goals of the BXA program is to help students develop a technical and conceptual literacy that crosses disciplinary boundaries. This kind of literacy requires not just disciplinary knowledge but practice in articulating ideas in ways that effectively reach very different audiences. This course will give you the opportunity to develop skills in identifying and targeting audiences in a variety of rhetorical modes and genres.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">52-291 Building BXA: A Project Course</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The ultimate goal of Building BXA is to produce, as a class, a communal space that represents BXA and provides a dedicated social space for all students. Over the course of six weeks, this class will propose, plan, and build the space, gaining experience in project management, collaboration, marketing, and budgeting.  The details, both large and small, are entirely up to you. BXA will provide help organizing and funding the project, but the rest is in the hands of the class. What kind of space do you want to see? What happens inside that space? How will you design and furnish the space? How will you promote it to the university at large?.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">52-390 BXA Undergraduate Research Project</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring<br />The BXA Undergraduate Research Project is for students who want to work on a self-designed project with the one-to-one guidance of a faculty advisor. The project should be interdisciplinary in nature, and can be a scholarly and/or creative endeavor. The project may take the form of a written thesis, a compilation of creative works, an outreach project, etc. The project topic must be pre-approved by the faculty member who agrees to supervise the project and assign a letter grade for the course. Projects are to be completed in one semester, may be worth 3, 6, 9, or 12 units of academic credit, and cannot be taken concurrently with the BXA Capstone Project during the senior year. To register, students must submit an "Undergraduate Research Project Proposal Form" signed by both the student and the faculty advisor, along with a proposal, to the BXA Director/Academic Advisor.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">52-391 BXA Junior Portfolio Review</dt>
<dd>Spring<br />To better assess the progress and accomplishments of BXA students as they enter their final year, students submit a portfolio for review during the spring semester junior year. Students should work with their BXA advisor and their concentration faculty advisors to assemble a portfolio that represents their academic and creative accomplishments over the course of their college career. This portfolio should also include a reflective essay in which students evaluate how they integrated their two areas of interest, and how they will extend that integration into the BXA Capstone Project in the senior year.  Students should identify their own specific goals for their academic career and how they are fulfilling them in this reflective essay, as well as how they evaluate their performance in light of the programs' broader pedagogical goals. Students in the BXA program should be working toward being able to: describe the connections between their chosen concentration disciplines and to integrate them into their work; communicate ideas in writing, visual expression, and oral expression; discuss the intersection of history, society, and culture from local and global perspectives; synthesize mathematical theories and experimental work to produce real-world knowledge; and use cognitive, behavioral, and ethical dimensions to make decisions on individual and social levels.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">52-399 BXA Interdisciplinary Seminar</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br />The BXA Interdisciplinary Seminar has been designed primarily for BXA internal transfer students and it is offered in the fall and spring semesters. Using the arts as primary modes of inquiry, this course's content probes the idiosyncratic field of arts-based research by following the principle that there is no aspect of human life that cannot be studied objectively, quantified and analyzed. Aside from discussing a digest of the latest writings on arts-based research, students will try their own approach to arts-based research by building prismatic artistic and literary constructs inspired by the reading of some of the most relevant contributions to the famed Charles Eliot Norton Lectures delivered at Harvard University. Texts will include excepts from Italo Calvino's Six Memos for the Next Millennium, Frank Stella's Working Space, Umberto Eco's Six Walks in the Fictional Woods, Jorge Luis Borges' This Craft of Verse, Luciano Berio's Remembering the Future, Leonard Bernstein's The Unanswered Question, and John Cage's I-IV.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">52-400 BXA Capstone Project</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br />The BXA Capstone Project gives BXA students the opportunity to demonstrate the extent of their interdisciplinary work over the course of their academic career. The Capstone Project should include elements that span the student's CFA and DC concentrations (for BHA students), CFA and MCS concentrations (for BSA students), or CFA and SCS concentrations (for BCSA students). The project can be either a scholarly or creative endeavor, and may take one of many possible forms (e.g., a written thesis, a compilation of creative work or works, an experiment and report, a computer program or animation, etc.).   The BXA Capstone sequence covers both semesters of a student's senior year. In the fall, students are enrolled in <a href="/search/?P=52-401" title="52-401" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '52-401');">52-401</a> BXA Capstone Project I (9 units), which meets weekly to discuss strategies for managing research, planning the project, and larger theoretical issues related to interdisciplinary work. At the end of the fall course, students will have produced a Capstone Project proposal, an annotated bibliography, and multiple versions of their project pitch. In the spring, students enroll in <a href="/search/?P=52-402" title="52-402" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '52-402');">52-402</a> BXA Capstone Project II (9 units), which has no required classroom time. Instead, students spend the semester doing the research and foundational work necessary for the project, as well as meeting with their faculty and BXA advisors as they create their Capstone Project and prepare to present it at the annual Meeting of the Minds Undergraduate Research Symposium held each May.  Students will only be enrolled in <a href="/search/?P=52-400" title="52-400" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '52-400');">52-400</a> (9 units) when they are unable to complete a two-semester sequence and need to gain special permission by the BXA Director/Academic Advisor.<br />

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Subcultures: Style, Structure, Representation &#8212; This seminar will examine contemporary and historical subcultures, particularly youth subcultures, through interdisciplinary modes of analysis, using theory and methodologies from several fields (particularly anthropology, communication studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, history, Marxism, modernism/post-modernism, performance studies, queer theory, sociology, and structuralism/post-structuralism). We will analyze the roots, performances, identities, and representations of subcultures, especially those with rituals and presentations centered on artistic mediums (music, fashion, graphic arts, street art, etc.). Though this course will focus primarily on the American experience, at times we will incorporate transnational perspectives to study the Beats, greasers, Mods, punks, skinheads, b-boys and girls, Goths, and "geek cultures" (comics, cosplay, gaming), among others. This course will pay careful attention to nuances of gender, race, class, and age in understanding the meaning of subcultures&#8212;symbolically, politically, and personally. Course requirements may include individual student research and leadership of class discussions.<br />

<dd>Fall and Spring<br />An internship is a supervised professional work experience with clear links to a student's academic goals. BXA students may choose to complete a BXA Internship for elective credit with appropriate individuals or organizations within or outside of Carnegie Mellon University. Junior and senior BXA students in good academic standing are eligible to receive academic credit for one internship. Grading is pass/no pass only. Prior to enrolling in an internship, the student must have a "BXA Internship Agreement Form" signed by their site supervisor and approved by the BXA Director/Academic Advisor.<br />

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br /><a href="/search/?P=99-200" title="99-200" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '99-200');">99-200</a> Tutoring, Mentoring and Role Modeling-A Community Service Course    This course has service, intellectual, and personal goals. Its service goal is to provide effective tutors, mentors, and role models to local public school children. Students meet for class once/week and tutor 26 hours during the semester in programs that provide an opportunity to share talents and skills in the community.  To promote effectiveness, the course includes topics of tutoring (making tutoring interesting and creative, focusing on meta-learning strategies and study skills); mentoring (exploring multiple mentoring models and the mutual benefits of a mentoring relationship); and informed citizenship (gaining a broader understanding of the issues that urban kids face, exploring how public policies affect the disparities between urban and suburban school student performance.  The course also investigates the reasons that "supplemental educational services" are a $27 billion/year industry in the United States  -- Why are so many students in need of extra help? Tutors learn that they can be effective in helping younger students, and that it is personally rewarding to do so, and express that it is refreshing to step outside the grind of Carnegie Mellon life and do something meaningful in the community.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">99-238 Materials, Energy and Environment</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The survival of humans and the advancement of civilization and culture are a result of mankinds' continued development of materials. From early times, civilizations with the most advanced materials have dominated the history of warfare and have been responsible for the infrastructural developments that have cradled out societies. As a result, materials have been influential in the trade and commerce between societies and are still to this day, strongly involved in the political, economic and social conflicts worldwide.    Materials do not stand alone in development however, they are a result of, or are influenced by, technological needs and developments. The more advanced the material, the more energy and effort is required for its' production. In the US, the production of materials accounts for about 90% of the country's energy usage. This fact clearly indicates a strong tie between materials and energy, and without energy, technological developments based on material advancement will not occur.    In our world today, the need to provide improved performance, economics and design in consumer goods comes as a direct result of the market conditions established by consumers. Material selection and design therefore is driven by application and consumer needs which implies that the consumer has a large influence on material consumption. Material selection and material usage in turn have major ecological  implications in energy, material resources and direct environmental impact. Awareness of the complicated interaction is paramount for continued development of civilization. With the scale of industrialization that exists on our planet, consideration of  resource management, ethical material selection choices, energy management, and final disposal are all necessary to ensure a sustainable future.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">99-241 Revolutions of Circularity</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />In this course we will investigate how the apparently simple concept of circularity (both in stillness and in motion) has accreted meaning. Starting with the circle as presented in early geometry, we will encompass circularity in ancient and Renaissance astronomy as well as classical physics. We will also discuss appearances of the circle in literature, philosophy, and art since our study will reveal connections such as how Aristotle's views on nature influenced Ptolemy and an understanding of our place in relation to the world, including central imagery in the poetry of Donne. As we demonstrate proofs and analyze texts, circularity will emerge not only as a device through which intellectual revolutions have occurred, but also as an object that has itself been transformed over the centuries.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">99-242 Meaning Across the Millennia</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Is it possible to convey messages that remain comprehensible after immense time, in the face of inevitable cultural shifts and physical decay? In this course, students will come to terms with the technical and philosophical aspects to this problem while working on group projects to propose solutions to the preservation of memory. Along the way, we will identify the challenges in extracting meaning from artifacts, both ancient and contemporary, such as documents and monuments, whether intentional or unintentional. We will also confront ethical and esthetic issues in identifying what is worth preserving, the challenge of societal pressures on past projects, the possibility of future indifference, and the question of what purpose this endeavor may serve for present-day humanity. Case studies will include time capsules such as those created by the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company for the 1939 and 1964 New York World's Fairs; the proposed warning marker system for the U.S. Department of Energy Waste Isolation Pilot Plant; the Voyager Golden Records launched aboard two interplanetary probes; and attempts at communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.<br />

<dd>Fall and Spring: 3 units<br />Self Defense for Women - is a course specifically designed to increase women's awareness of potential sexual assault and to provide physical techniques to respond to such an act.  It is intended for women only because it is believed that the presence of males in class (other than instructors or other authorized persons) can alter the emotional and physical responses of women to class material and thereby hinder their ability to reach course objectives.  It is of the utmost importance that women be able to maximize their opportunity to learn in the company of like-minded students.  The core of the course is based upon the principles of the Rape Aggression Defense System (R.A.D.)which was conceived and developed by Larry N. Nadeau.  His goal in developing R.A.D. is also its motto:  "To develop and enhance the options of self-defense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked."  This course is composed of three sections:  risk reduction principles, physical defense techniques, and simulation.  Risk reduction principles include a thorough review of personal self-awareness & the environment, whether in the home, neighborhood, or unfamiliar community.  Physical defense techniques include the introduction to bodily strikes with hands, kicks with the feet, and defenses against grabs & holds.  Simulation is the activity that attempts to incorporate, via physical demonstration, all emotional & physical techniques that have been taught through the acting out of scenarios involving instructors (padded/protected) as attackers, and students (padded/protected) responding to the assault.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">39-100 Special Topics: WHAT IS ENGINEERING?</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />What is Engineering?  In today's world, we are so used to technology, helping us yet giving rise to complex problems, our friend and yet sometimes our challenge in preserving all that is human. This course is an introduction to all students about what engineers do and how they do it.  It is about the culture, the thinking, the creativity and more than anything else, the doing which is at the heart of engineering.    On a more pragmatic level, our world of ever-increasing technological complexity demands that everyone is to some extent familiar with things technical.  William A. Wulf, President of the National Academy of Engineering, has said that a public that is technologically less than literate and unable to understand technical decisions is left to trust that good decisions will be made on their behalf.     We invite you to take this course to get a feeling for what engineers experience in their work and bring out the creativity in each of you.  The goal of this course is to help Carnegie Mellon students of all disciplines understand the role and impact of engineering in modern society and participate in the excitement of engineering.  Demonstrations and hands-on projects will give students the experience of what engineers do.  After completing this course you will have a better understanding of the contributions of engineering to our society, how engineers see and think about the world, what the "big issues"  for engineers are, what's involved in the different fields of engineering, and the tools engineers use. The multi-disciplinary and collaborative nature of almost all engineering work will be stressed.        <a href="/search/?P=39-100" title="39-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '39-100');">39-100</a> is open to first through third year students in all majors except engineering.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">39-600 Integrated Product Development</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />The IPD course focuses on team-based integrated product development among  engineering, business, and design disciplines.  The course is open to  seniors and graduate students in engineering, industrial and communication  design, and MBA students.  The course generally has about a dozen students  from each discipline.  The course consists of four modules including  identifying, understanding, conceptualizing and introducing a product  opportunity.  In recent years we have partnered with industrial sponsors to  address a customer opportunity, resulting in patent applications.  The  emphasis in the course is on the early, "fuzzy" stage of product  development.  The course gives structure to these stages and helps direct  the process to be more efficient downstream.  Students are expected to  produce four phase written and oral reports.  At the end of the semester the  team will develop a form prototype, function prototype, marketing plan and  manufacturing plan for the product.This course has gained an international reputation as a leading course in new product development.     Course admission by permission of professor only; all students will be  waitlisted until admission decisions are made.  Students should contact  the professor for an application for the course.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">39-605 Engineering Design Projects</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />In this project course, students work in multidisciplinary teams to design products or processes.  The course is open to juniors, seniors and graduate students from all parts of the campus community.  Each project is sponsored by an industry, government or non-profit partner, and is of real commercial interest to that partner.  Students work directly with their partner throughout the semester to establish goals and requirements, evaluate their design as it progresses, and produce a final report, presentation, and, if appropriate, a prototype.  Design reviews, held twice during the semester, give students a chance to present their preliminary designs and receive feedback and advice.  In completing their designs, teams must consider not only the functionality of their designs, but also the look, feel, appearance, and societal impact.  Skills built in this course will include: developing the product statement, establishing goals and constraints for the product, project management, and generating and evaluating design alternatives.  As some projects may span multiple semesters with new groups of students, careful documentation of project work is emphasized.  Students may take this course for either one or two semesters.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-090 Introduction to Signal Processing for Creative Practice</dt>
<dd>Fall: 10 units<br />Signals are the raw materials used in many forms of electronic art - video, electronic music, interactive art, kinetic sculpture, and more. In these fields, signals are used to represent information about sound, images, sensors, and movement. By transforming and manipulating these types of signals, we are able to create powerful new tools for digital art, multimedia design, music composition and performance, responsive environments, video and sound installation, mobile applications, and beyond.  In this course we will study Signal Processing from a practical point-of-view, developing tools that can be easily integrated into art-making using the graphical programming environment Max (a.k.a. Max/MSP/Jitter).  We will present a survey of Signal Processing techniques used in the sonic and visual arts, and will discuss the mathematical theories underlying these techniques.  Students will be encouraged to combine, modify, and extend working examples of software to create original digital artworks. Course development by Richard Stern and Tom Sullivan.<br />

We then focus on formal techniques and theory for analyzing the functionality, timing, power consumption, and chip area properties of these basic circuits and ones yet to be presented. From there, we move to more complex adders (carry-lookahead, carry-skip, carry_bypass, Wallace trees, and hybrid techniques) and multipliers (sequential, array, Booth, and others) along with various divider circuits. Floating point units are then built upon the concepts introduced for adder, multipliers, and dividers. Finally, we will investigate the design and implementation of digital filter circuits. For each circuit introduced, we will develop techniques for evaluating their functionality, their speed, power consumption, and silicon area requirements. In addition, we will utilize various CAD tools to design and evaluate most of the computation circuits discussed. After successful completion of the course, students will not only have an understanding of complex computation circuits, but subtle concepts that include hazards, metastability, false paths, inertial delay, sticky bits, clock skew/jitter, dynamic and static sensitization, and many others. 3 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=18-240" title="18-240" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-240');">18-240</a></dd>

Therefore, sensors, transducers, and the initial signal processing remain in the analog domain.  Simultaneously, the commercial market place optimizes sensor technology based upon multiple attributes including cost, detectivity, size, speed, etc.  In this course we explore both the many types of possible responses to various physical stimuli, as well as the instrumentation, electronic detection, signal conversion and signal processing techniques used to bring the physical event into the electronic world in a practical manner.  This requires that we learn about the diversity of physical phenomena, materials and devices that can be used to convert the various forms of physical energy into electronic signals.  Due to the significant diversity of physical phenomena the course requires reading from textbooks, the technical literature and patent literature.

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-513 RF Circuits and Antennas for Wireless Systems</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />The demand for wireless products is growing at an impressive rate. This interdisciplinary course will team students from electromagnetics with students from analog circuit design to explore the concepts of basic antenna design and measurement as well as RF transceivers. The students will have the opportunity to design and build  transmitter or receiver sub-systems, based on their application of interest.  Designs may be done with discrete components for AM, FM and VHF (TV) receptions or with integrated components for UHF applications, such TV, wi-fi, etc. Integrated with these efforts will be the design of several types of widely used antennas. Students will design, construct, and test an antenna to meet stated specifications using a combination of theory, electromagnetic simulators and lab experiments.  The focus of this course will be the construction of an antenna/tranciever system. In addition to the project, several lectures will be given to introduce students to the specific applications and to consolidate previous course materials as they apply to the project.<br />Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=18-300" title="18-300" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-300');">18-300</a> and <a href="/search/?P=18-320" title="18-320" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-320');">18-320</a>) or <a href="/search/?P=18-402" title="18-402" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-402');">18-402</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-525 Integrated Circuit Design Project</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />This course is intended to provide the electrical and computer engineering student with IC design experience. It solidifies the theoretical background and practical skills gained in 18320 and 18422.    The primary stress of the class will be on the IC design process as a whole. Such a process, seen as a sequence of design decisions, must lead to a design which optimizes a given objective function under a number of constraints. The optimum design must be achieved using a number of variables involving all levels of design abstraction and ranging between architecture choice and detail of the IC layout.     Typical design objectives adopted in class designs will be IC performance (throughput, power, signal-to-noise ratio, clock frequency, gain-bandwidth, etc.) and typical constraints will be die size and minimum feature size.    The second most important objective of the class is to mimic a large design team environment in which individual designers must: (a) communicate precisely and efficiently his/her ideas and (b) utilize any feedback provided by the "design environment." This objective will be achieved through class presentations given by each student and by stressing the importance of design documentation.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=18-320" title="18-320" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-320');">18-320</a> and (<a href="/search/?P=18-310" title="18-310" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-310');">18-310</a> or <a href="/search/?P=18-340" title="18-340" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-340');">18-340</a> or <a href="/search/?P=18-341" title="18-341" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-341');">18-341</a> or <a href="/search/?P=18-415" title="18-415" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-415');">18-415</a> or <a href="/search/?P=18-450" title="18-450" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-450');">18-450</a> or <a href="/search/?P=18-491" title="18-491" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-491');">18-491</a>).<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-540 Rapid Prototyping of Computer Systems</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br />This is a project-oriented course which will deal with all four aspects of project development; the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment, and the physical prototyping facilities. The class, in conjunction with the instructors, will develop specifications for a mobile computer to assist in inspection and maintenance. The application will be partitioned between human computer interaction, electronics, industrial design, mechanical, and software components. The class will be divided into groups to specify, design, and implement the various subsystems. The goal is to produce a working hardware/software prototype of the system and to evaluate the user acceptability of the system. We will also monitor our progress in the design process by capturing our design escapes (errors) with the Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). Upon completion of this course the student will be able to: generate systems specifications from a perceived need; partition functionality between hardware and software; produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems; use computer-aided design tools; fabricate, integrate, and debug a hardware/software system; and evaluate the system in the context of an end user application.

Lectures will complement the laboratory experience with comparative surveys, operational principles, and integrated design issues associated with the spectrum of mechanism, electronics, and control components. Class lectures will cover topics intended to complement the laboratory work, including mechanisms, actuators, motor drives, sensors and electronic interfaces, microcontroller hardware and programming and basic controls. During the first week of class, each student will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their technical background. The class will then be divided into multi-disciplinary teams of three students. During the first half of the class, lab assignments will be made every 1-2 weeks to construct useful subsystems based on material learned in lecture. The lab assignments are geared to build to the main project.

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-610 Fundamentals of Modern CMOS Devices</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br />This course is intended to provide a foundation in device operation for circuit designers working in today's sub-micron CMOS. This course will also provide advanced understanding of CMOS technology for those interested in integrated circuit process technology and device physics.  We review semiconductor device physics, including carrier dynamics and the basic equations of semiconductor device physics. The operation of the p-n junction diode is also reviewed. The course includes a description of integrated circuit fabrication technology and how it is used to fabricate CMOS devices. With this foundation, we then discuss the MOS capacitor (including its application as a varactor). The theory of the MOS transistor will then be developed, followed by a discussion of important phenomena in sub-micron devices such as: velocity saturation; breakdown; drain-induced barrier lowering; random dopant fluctuations, etc. The student will learn the relationship between device geometry, e.g. length, and fabrication, e.g. doping, and the corresponding circuit performance.    The course will primarily be lecture-based, with some selected simulation exercises. Students are expected to be acquainted with the basic concepts of electrical circuits; electromagnetic fields at the level of a sophomore level physics course, and to have adequate preparation in mathematics (basic differential equations and MATLAB or similar applications). Prior coursework in device physics is helpful but not required for graduate students.

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-615 Micro and Nano Systems Fabrication</dt>
<dd>All Semesters: 12 units<br />This course is intended to introduce students to the process flow and design methodology for integrated systems fabrication. The course will present this material through two paths. Lectures will be presented on the basic unit processes of micro and nanosystems fabrication: deposition, patterning, and etching. Lectures will draw on examples from:    Semiconductor device fabrication;   Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication;   Magnetic device fabrication, and;   Optical device fabrication.   Problem sets will be given based on this lecture material to allow students to quantitatively analyze certain process steps in detail. The second path for material presentation will be through a series of labs that allow students to design, fabricate and test an integrated device. These laboratories will be scheduled at regular meeting times, and will use research facilities within the ECE Department.    6 hrs. lec., 6 hrs. lab    Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=18-310" title="18-310" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-310');">18-310</a>, senior standing with instructor's permission, or graduate standing<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=18-310" title="18-310" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-310');">18-310</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-623 Analog Integrated Circuit Design</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />Some form of analog circuit design is a critical step in the creation of every modern IC. First and foremost, analog circuits act as the  interface between digital systems and the real world. They act to  amplify and filter analog signals, and to convert signals from analog to digital and back again. In addition, high performance digital cell  design (either high speed or low power) also invokes significant analog  circuit design issues. The goal of this course is to teach students some of the methods used in the design and analysis of analog integrated circuits, to illustrate how one approaches design problems in general, and to expose students to a broad cross-section of important analog circuit topologies. The course will focus on learning design through carrying out design projects. Design and implementation details of wide-band amplifiers, operational amplifiers, continuous-time filters, phase lock loops and data converters will be covered. The course will focus primarily on analog CMOS, but some aspects of BJT design will be discussed. 4 hrs. lec.

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-649 Distributed Embedded Systems</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br />Embedded computers seem to be everywhere, and are increasingly used in applications as diverse as transportation, medical equipment, industrial controls, and consumer products. This course covers how to design and analyze distributed embedded systems, which typically consist of multiple processors on a local area network performing real time control tasks. The topics covered will include issues such as communication protocols, synchronization, real-time operation, fault tolerance, distributed I/O, design validation, and industrial implementation concerns. The emphasis will be on areas that are specific to embedded distributed systems as opposed to general-purpose networked workstation applications. This course assumes that students already know fundamental topics such as interrupts, basic I/O, and uniprocessor scheduling that are commonly taught in introduction-level embedded system courses such as <a href="/search/?P=18-348" title="18-348" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-348');">18-348</a> and <a href="/search/?P=18-349" title="18-349" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '18-349');">18-349</a>.

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-715 Physics of Applied Magnetism</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br />In this course we address the physics of magnetism of solids with emphasis on magnetic material properties and phenomena which are useful in various applications. Various applications of magnetism are used to motivate the understanding of the physical properties and phenomena.     The content of this course includes the origins of magnetism at the atomic level and the origins of magnetic ordering (ferro-, ferri-, and antiferro-magnetism), magnetic anisotropy, magnetic domains, domain walls, spin dynamics and electronic transport at the crystalline level. The principles of magnetic crystal symmetry, tensors, and energy minimization are utilized to explore magnetic properties such as resonance, domain structures, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, magnetostriction and magnetoelasticity, and susceptibility.  Phenomenological properties, such as the technical magnetization process, are used to describe mechanisms of coercivity, eddy current effects and losses, while energy minimization and relaxation are used to explain properties such as single domain particle behavior, memory mechanisms, magnetic aftereffects and thermal stability.

<dt class="keepwithnext">18-716 Advanced Applied Magnetism</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br />Over the past decade, magnetism has once again become one of the dominant themes in material science and solid-state physics. Today, the development of new thin film recording media and the discovery of giant magnetoresistance have resulted in the amount of stored bits in a single disk drive to reach astronomical numbers. Rapid advances in spin-polarized electrical transport have brought to the horizon a new kind of electronics, called spintronics, with a new functionality based upon the spin of the carriers. The newly enriched magnetism brings unbounded technologic opportunities, yet full of challenges. This course will cover many of the important technological applications of advanced magnetism. The emphasis will be placed on how the basic principles and concepts are applied. The topics include: (1) Application and theory of spin dependent transport: CIP and CPP GMR devices, spin injection in semiconductors, spin LED, spin transistors, and spin current induced magnetic switching; (2) Engineering of the magnetic material properties for: thin film recording media, recording heads, magnetoresistive random access memory; (3) Thermally excited ferromagnetic resonance: mag-noise in magnetic devices, and thermally activated magnetization reversal; (4) Continuous and patterned magnetic films: magnetic bubble technology and patterned media; (5) Magnetostriction: magnetostrictive sensors; (6) Magnetic imaging techniques: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic force microscopy (MFM), differential-phase-contrast microscopy (DPC), SEMPA, and Kerr microscopy. 4 hrs. lec.

<dt class="keepwithnext">19-101 Introduction to Engineering and Public Policy</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br />This course examines the processes of public and private decision making and of policy formation, which shape the evolution of a technology and its impact on our society. Technology plays an important role in shaping our worlds. At the same time, social forces often play a central role in the evolution of a technology. A particular technology such as an automobile or computer is chosen to study technology and policy in context. Specific topics covered in the case of the automobile includes automotive design and manufacture, safety, pollution, fuel economy and their interactions. In each area, we discuss the technological and institutional issues, their interaction, the possible need for public policy and the factors that govern the policy. The course will involve several group problem-solving sessions.<br />Corequisites: <a href="/search/?P=21-120" title="21-120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-120');">21-120</a> and 21-121 and <a href="/search/?P=33-106" title="33-106" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '33-106');">33-106</a></dd>

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Should autonomous robots make life and death decisions on their own? Should we allow them to select a target and launch weapons? To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around? Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go? Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons? Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe? As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates. Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking. The course will enhance students' ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">19-611 Special Topics:Global Competitiveness: Firms, Nations and Technological Change</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />This course introduces students to the fundamental principles surrounding global competitiveness and technological change in the 21st century.  The past twenty years have seen dramatic changes in innovation ecosystems in the U.S. and internationally.  Alone within the U.S., there has been a sharp decline in corporate R&amp;D labs, matched by the global fragmentation of firm activities.  At the same time growing linkages have been observed across institutional   firms, government labs, and universities   and national borders.  These changes raise critical questions about the new rules of the game driving technological change in the 21st century.  This course sheds insights into these questions through the lenses of competing economic, sociological, and political science theories on the structures supporting technological change.  The course is broken into three sections.  The first section introduces students to theories of the firm, bureaucracy, institutional economics, and social networks as competing frameworks within which to understand technological change.  The second section presents the contemporary literature on the technological change, including creative destruction, dominate designs, industry life cycles, and networks of innovators. The concluding section leverages lessons from the preceding two sections to evaluate national innovation systems, and the factors that lead to national comparative advantage.  Students should leave the class able to reflect competently on what the existing literature tells us about the factors influencing global technology competitiveness, and on how modern changes in the structures supporting innovation as well as technology itself may be changing the rules of the game for firms and for nations.

The course introduces the principles, concepts, frameworks and proven practices for analysis and strategic decision-making in an uncertain and constrained environment ? i.e. when ample historical data and large budgets don't exist.  A customer-centric orientation is emphasized throughout the course. The course addresses marketing decisions and activities including identifying value creation opportunities; generating and selecting innovation ideas; analyzing the market, competition, customer needs and customer experience; market segmentation, targeting and positioning strategy; customer value proposition; marketing-mix decisions for product, pricing, route-to-market/distribution, and promotion/communications; and hypothesis-based decision validation. The perspective of this course will be from a role of a strategic marketer, which is typically held by a product manager, strategic marketing manager, product planning manager, product marketing manager, new business development manager, innovation manager, or entrepreneur/CEO.  The course uses lectures, readings, group exercises, final exam and an individual project to achieve the learning objectives. For the individual project, students will analyze the opportunity and develop a marketing strategy for a technological-based innovation idea of their choice. This course is ideal for students with technical undergraduate degrees. Instructor is planning to have a syllabus with details in late November that interested students can request from him.<br />

<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br />Exploring Audience and Ideas in the Arts: "Passport" is an introductory level course that explores the philosophy of aesthetics through direct attendance at performances and exhibitions. The course is constructed in modules that represent each school within the College of Fine Arts (architecture, art, design, drama and music) building toward cross-disciplinary practice. Each module contains a guest lecture, event attendance, and follow-up discussion which serve as points of entry into each discipline as well as points of comparison within the arts as a whole. These three components provide a direct link between theory and practice allowing students to gain a critical vocabulary to discuss their experiences.    Outside of class, supplementary readings, audience participation, and written reflections provide an opportunity for students to use course material to enrich their own artistic practice. Ultimately, students are asked to consider their roles as an artist: within their discipline, within the arts, and within the broader community. This course concludes with a final symposium/exhibition of participating students.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">62-325 View Camera</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 10 units<br />The nature of a 4x5" view camera alters both the process of making a photograph and the qualities of the resulting image. The slow, even cumbersome, process of photographing with a large format camera encourages a methodical, studied approach. The larger negative size and the ability to control the exposure and development of each sheet of film make possible an image of extraordinary clarity and detail. Through a series of exercises followed by a self-selected project, students in this class will learn the technical aspects, and master the use of, the view camera. Topics include: perspective and focal plane control, bellows extension factor, and basic B&W sheet film handling and processing. Students should enter this course already possessing a working knowledge of photographic processing and printing.

<dt class="keepwithnext">62-326 Photographic Narrative</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Most photographs tell stories. We see photographs in newspapers, magazines, snapshot albums, on the web, in books, and in posters. In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles. Photographs can work without words, too, to create purely visual narratives.  In this course, students will make two series of photographs: one that is fiction and one that is non-fiction. In addition to making photographs, students will determine the context in which their photo-stories will be seen. Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen on a website.  While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photo-graphic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who constructed private worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Charlesworth, and Laurie Simmons. As students explore both fiction and non-fiction through photographs, we will look at the interesting interplay between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create tempos; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives.

<dt class="keepwithnext">62-360 Photographers and Photography Since World War II</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, as pursued by Lewis Hine, while the other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz, founder of the elite Photo-Secession movement in the United States, who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul. As such they were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.    This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Harry Callahan, Charles "Teenie" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Annie Leibovitz, Duane Michals, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include lectures, student presentations, and video excerpts. A local field trip to visit a photography exhibition may also be arranged.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">48-026 First Year Seminar: Architecture Edition II</dt>
<dd>Spring: 3 units<br />The first year seminar (part 2) introduces students to opportunities at Carnegie Mellon University and beyond.  The goal of this course is to encourage students to pursue their interests inside and outside of the School of Architecture by introducing a range of opportunities, including study abroad experiences, internships, academic minors/additional majors, and graduate study.  The introduction of the study abroad process and travel options will encourage students to consider a study away experience into their academic curriculum.  Students will explore their additional academic interests by identifying their psychological preferences through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and matching these preferences with academic minors/additional majors at CMU.   The presentation of the Intern Development Program (IDP) will engage students in considering future plans for earning IDP hours and understanding the process of securing an architectural internship.  Students will be introduced to the process of developing an independent research project.  Additional topical areas to be covered in the seminar will include an evaluation of the previous semester, scholarship/academic funding opportunities, graduate studies, and schedule planning for upcoming semesters.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">48-095 Spatial Concepts for Non-Architects I</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 10 units<br />This course serves as an introduction to the spatial concepts of architecture for students from other disciplines. The course is focused entirely on project design work (this is not an historical survey, technical or lecture course). This course is very hands-on  Projects will explore the design and experience of spatial environments through a series of creative investigations. The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them. This will consist of short projects, with each design investigation progressively building upon the previous exploration; these early projects will consist of both individual and group work. They will focus on Making.  The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question.  Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips. Students are encouraged to explore their own areas of interest with respect to their work in class. Self-motivation, class attendance and an open mind is mandatory, however, no prior architectural, engineering or artistic experience is required. Students are expected to perform work both inside and outside of class. Students should be prepared to purchase various supplies throughout the course. This course is in partial fulfillment of requirements for an Architecture Minor.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">48-100 Architecture Design Studio: Foundation I</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />As the first architectural design studio course, the Foundation I studio establishes a fundamental understanding of representation and abstraction to which more of your own thoughts and ideas about spatial thinking can be added. This will involve, by means of the architectural studio, a reiterative investigation into the relationship of technique, form, and meaning through study, invention, testing, and evaluation. During this semester a series of short problems will be given to expose you to the complexities of visual communication and the design act; to develop skills of spatial manipulation; to give you the self-confidence in making valid decisions within set time limits; to develop the skills of graphic presentation necessary for interpreting and communicating your architectural intentions; and above all, to instill the ability to combine insight with the rigorous analytical study in a ?design process? that is efficient, personally effective, and which becomes second nature to you as a working process.<br />

We continue to emphasize architectural drawing and models (both analog and digital) as the primary means of architectural communication, but also as a method of creatively exploring and rigorously testing fundamental architectural ideas.  We investigate, research, analyze, diagram, and apply lessons from local architecture, and great architecture of the past, in studio, and in the parallel survey of architectural history.   We introduce the use of ?systems,? ?computational thinking,? and ?rules? in the design process to create order, deal with a range of parameters, and satisfy specific performance criteria.  Beginning with more abstract formal design exercises, and ending with the design of a small building, we explore how tectonics, joinery, materials, as well as site, orientation, context, and human use can be harnessed to inspire great design.  The design process is still carefully controlled, but students are encouraged to begin to speculate and take careful risks.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=48-100" title="48-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '48-100');">48-100</a></dd>

<dd>Fall: 18 units<br />This studio is an introduction to architectural design stressing concept generation and the development of a rich design process to create evocative spatial experiences through architecture.  Building on the explorations of form and space in the 1st year, we investigate in greater depth the role that program, context, and the physical "elements of architecture" play in creating meaningful architecture.   We seek to understand design principles underlying the buildings of the past and present, from the broadly theoretical and conceptual, to the real implications of tectonics and sustainability, and apply these ideas with intent and significance.  We will focus on developing challenging architectural ideas, profound building details, and effective ways of communicating them in order to explore architecture's potential for creating poetic expressions, appropriate shelter, or exalted experiences, as well as its ability to embody ideas and impart meaning to the world around us.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=48-105" title="48-105" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '48-105');">48-105</a></dd>

<dd>Spring: 18 units<br />Building on the fall studio, the spring semester is concerned with more in-depth understanding and development of designs for small-scale buildings, now informed by greater knowledge related to materials, fabrication, and the act of construction.  Following the "New Materiality" evident in architecture today, and acknowledging the importance of materials and assembly techniques for sustainable design, we seek to explore the aesthetic and experiential meaning of materials (WHY?), and the technical knowledge related to the use of materials and the processes of construction (HOW?).  The creative opportunities and design implications of using varied materials, structural systems, fabrication and assembly techniques&#8212;both analogue and digital&#8212;are elaborated, especially as they determine the artistic, conceptual, poetic, creative, spatial, and experiential aspects of architecture.

As part of the technology sequence, <a href="/search/?P=48-215" title="48-215" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '48-215');">48-215</a> introduces and examines the fundamentals between design intent and construction materials, the science of materials (performance) and their assemblies. Learning how materials and techniques inform spatial and form making decisions will be a central theme to the semester. Lectures and discussions will focus on the meaning, aesthetics and techniques related to the use of materials and the process of construction. Field trips will provide further depth into these topics. A basic understanding of essential, well-known systems of building construction will be our base line. Discussions and case studies of contemporary systems that extend, experiment and question these known systems will introduce you to the great depth to which this basic knowledge can lead you. Joint assignments with the second year design studio will provide you with an opportunity for an in-depth exploration of these fundamentals of construction through a direct application and synthesis of this new knowledge to your studio project. This course will introduce a basic understanding, selection, design, preliminary sizing and methodology of construction systems organized by the 16 divisions of construction, as defined by the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) as well as and introduction to the International Building Code (IBC) with special attention given to fire protection, types of construction, and means of egress.<br />

Reflecting the inseparable relation between building and human needs, this course is not only a history of architecture, but also a history through architecture.  It examines architectural and urban design as a form of cultural expression unique to its time and place. The design, use, meaning and legacy of a building is conditioned not only by the architect's will or the patron's desire, but also by a web of technological, religious, social, cultural, economic, and political factors of the time. This foundation course is the first in the architectural history sequence, and introduces students to the subject and skills of world architectural history.

The spring semester of the third year of architectural studies at Carnegie Mellon University is concerned with the detailed development and refinement of an architectural design as informed by the technical knowledge of structural systems, enclosure systems and the process of construction. The student is expected to articulate concepts and develop designs with more precision and in greater detail than done in previous studios and courses. In addition to criteria related to the development of design skills appropriate to one's sixth semester of the studio sequence, the following criteria are an explicit part of the evaluation of the student work: Aesthetics: The degree to which the design responds to formal issues as articulated in prior design studios. Structural System: The degree to which the proposed building is presented as a statically stable structure which defines the spatial order and satisfies the architectural intentions made explicit in the project. Enclosure System: The degree to which the proposed enclosure system satisfies the design requirements and responds to the physical phenomena of the environment into which it is placed. Material Selection: The degree to which the selected building materials and their implementation are appropriate to the occupancy, articulate the architectural order, and satisfy the physical design requirements. Constructability: The degree to which the proposed building is developed in response to an understanding of the processes of construction.

<dd>All Semesters: 9 units<br />The history of the main cities of Europe during the XIX century is a history of change and transformation. The physical environment and the political, financial and administrative structures adapt to the needs of new masses of population and to the challenges of metropolitan life. In some cases, cities even acquire new representative functions, as they become a national capital.     This course traditionally offers an overview of the urban culture of XIX century Europe, reconstructing aspects of the broader historical context and then focusing on reading the effects of the XIX century transformations on the physical appearance, structures and image of present-day European cities, such as Paris, London, Berlin, Barcelona, Vienna and Rome.    This semester we will add to this analysis, acquired by learning and applying a set of essential questions about XIX century urban transformations, a second look at the image of the city - the issue of how the city is represented and described in the various moments of its Nineteenth century transformation (from historical maps, to paintings, from postcards to literary descriptions). We will try to consider its changing visual representation and the different perception of its character and peculiarities over time, finally discussing how the Nineteenth century image of each city still affects how it is viewed today. We will rely, along with the usual reading materials (articles, book excerpts) also on visual documentation, such as photography and film.

<dt class="keepwithnext">48-341 Theory &amp; Expression in Architecture</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This architectural history seminar will explore expression in architecture in its many forms, particularly in written works of architectural theory through the ages.  We start with the premise that architecture is not merely pragmatic, technical, or functional: it can express or communicate like a language, it can represent and inspire like many of the arts, it can shape behavior and emote, it can trigger memories, emotions, or meanings.  As Isozaki put it: ?Architecture is a machine for the production of meaning.?  We?ll investigate many ways that architects have theorized the design process, as well as the forms, materials, and contexts of architecture, to express a myriad of ideas and sensibilities.  We?ll also look at the ways that buildings can communicate and have meaning, often beyond the intent of the architect, and usually changing over time.  Some of the topics to be explored include the classical orders, gothic geometry and mystical light, the theatrical space of the Baroque, architecture parlante, character, and style in the Enlightenment, tectonics as structural expression, political architecture and morality, the aesthetics of functionalism, Expressionism, key terms such as ornament, representation, linguistics, and semiotics, as well as more recent theoretical constructs such as embodiment, materiality, atmosphere, and affect. The work of the seminar will include intensive weekly readings, especially of primary sources by the architects seeking to express ideas, weekly presentations and discussions about the sources, and a term paper on an important theory of expression in architecture of your choice.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=48-240" title="48-240" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '48-240');">48-240</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course surveys the architecture and urbanism of Mexico and Guatemala from prehistory to the 20th century, focusing on three critical periods of their cultural history and architectural development: (1) the Pre-Columbian development of Mesoamerica, primarily Maya and Aztec, (2) the Spanish colonial architecture and urbanism of the 16th-18th centuries, and (3) the 20th-century search for an appropriate regional and national modernism. When the Spanish conquistador Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s landed in 1519 in what is now Mexico, he encountered one of the world?s largest and most spectacular civilizations. The Aztec empire, however, was only the latest urban civilizations in a Mesoamerican tradition that stretched back more than 2,000 years. The ensuing European architectural and urban imprints can be seen as both a victory of colonialism?s political, social, and architectural ideals, and as a fusion combining European practices with indigenous conditions and traditions. Centuries later, as 20th-century Latin Americans grappled with the challenges of industrialization, economic swings, and political and social revolutions, architects, planners, and clients again sought to reconcile competing visions of national and modern identities.  Student work will include a research paper and several shorter written assignments throughout the semester.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=48-240" title="48-240" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '48-240');">48-240</a></dd>

It begins with the cataclysm of WWII and the fundamental shifts it caused in the conception of modernism, technology, cities, and geo-politics.  It proceeds to investigate themes such as rebuilding and reconstruction after the ?zero-hour,? grand modern masters such as Mies, Kahn, and Corbu, the fascination with technology, megastructures, and utopian thought, the need for monumentality, meaning, and regional identity, and the dissemination of modernism from corporate America to the third world.  It ends with the rupture in modernism associated with social revolutions and the rise of a post-modern architecture in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Required course Human Factors is an investigation of what makes buildings tick for people: the internal spaces, transitional spaces, transactional spaces, defensible space, owned space, shared space, public space, and most importantly, occupied space. We move up in scale from the individual and group to the community to consider our designers' biases in how we analyze the human needs, how we judge the quality of space and subsequently, how we apply this knowledge to our own design work. Students develop a research question and test it in field research using observation, interviews and surveys. They draw conclusions about the quality of a space and place and how to improve it. Students should leave this class with the ability to discern a problem, experience in applying their understanding of behavioral settings and the human condition to specific research foci, and the ability to use their knowledge and skills deftly in practice, where time and resources are limited. Assignments will be a mix of individual and group work, with emphasis on the latter. There will be an emphasis on reading relevant literature, field investigations and understanding research methods and collaboration for applications in practice.<br />

It aligns with the transactionalist understanding of perception and considers perspective as partly invented and partly discovered truth.     2)The Order of Appearance, which is built on the early work of the perceptual psychologist, J.J. Gibson, and aligns with the ecological  position of Gibson and his followers  It considers perspective as an absolute truth of the visual field.    3)Perspective Imposed, which aligns implicitly with the position of Gestalt  psychology.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This course will take you on a journey to the Mediterranean, especially to Italy, Greece and Turkey. It will also make you travel through time. We will examine the important Greek and Roman past of this region, with the main goal of understanding how this past was imagined, studied and slowly brought back to light in the late Eighteenth and Nineteenth century. The rediscovery provided essential material to the cultural debate and architectural production of many generations. We will study ancient cities and archeological sites, from the hills of Troy to the archeological sites of Pergamon and Ephesus, to the cities of Rome, Athens and Costantinople/Istambul. We will discuss how the eyes of scholars, travelers and artists filtered and transformed the reality of the ancient objects and places, adding to their fascination and vitality and changing the way we perceive this legacy today. We will learn how the new findings changed the vocabulary of the architects as well as the scholarship of the archaeologists. We will reflect on the new political agendas implied in the way the rich vestiges of the past of this region were appropriated, presented, displayed.  The course requires a fair amount of reading and writing. Personal elaboration is expected throughout.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This architectural history course examines the development of American house and housing choices during the period 1850-1975. A recurring picture of the "American Dream" has typically included the image of a single-family, detached dwelling set within its own green yard in the suburbs.  However powerful and durable that image is, the history of house and home in America is actually a far more complex story with many different twists and turns. In the course we will look at both urban and suburban housing choices and cultures, ranging from single family detached dwellings to multi-unit housing, and across a social spectrum income, class, race, and gender. Through the use of occasional field trips, we will use Pittsburgh as a touchstone for understanding broader national trends in the history of American urban and suburban housing. The course is organized as a lecture course supplemented with field trips and discussions based on field trips and primary source readings.  The additional time slot on Thursday afternoons will be used only when field trips are scheduled.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course examines the historical development of various regional patterns in the American built environment.  The focus will be primarily pre-20th century, when the forces of vernacular traditions were stronger, although it will also examine more recent trends of regionalism as an aesthetic choice and a theoretical stance.  Despite the leveling forces of mass culture and globalization, the geographic and social diversity of the U.S. has created distinctive regional mosaics of landscape and architecture. Say ?New England? and images of English Pilgrims, town greens with white framed churches, and industrial mill villages may come to mind. ?The Southwest? conjures different images, perhaps of adobe pueblos, Spanish friars, arid ranches, and the color turquoise. The built environment of the Midwest, the California coast, the Mississippi Delta, and many places in between reflect particular regional identities that have been both unconsciously and consciously created over time. This course investigates how and why a region?s architectural identity evolved in the ways that it did. To what degree is ?place? something to respond to, to interact with, and to what degree is place something that is created?

Yet, an esthetic and philosophical view of harmony with nature accompanies many forms of historical human activity in the built environment. Similarly, issues of waste removal, mechanical systems and natural materials that characterize current concerns have illustrative historical roots in numerous civilizations going back centuries and even millennia in pre-Industrial or non-industrial cultures. This course will engage texts and examples relating not simply architecture, landscape and urban history, but also art, philosophy and popular culture as a means to understand the many precedents for today?s interest in sustainable architecture and planning.

Students begin to understand equipment limits/boundaries, purposes and concepts; and the possibilities that arise from thoroughly comprehending how these tools work.    During your Digital Experience, students begin to understand more systematically how to use these tools to their advantage. A better understanding of the equipment proves very useful towards a SoArch Student's 3rd, 4th and 5th years at Carnegie Mellon; but more importantly provides a fundamental understanding of a leading edge technology that will certainly prove itself as an integral tool for any Designer throughout their professional career.    It is based on the idea that pushing the limits of design fabrication; comes from knowing the limits of your tools. The course operates by discovering tooling extremes; thus indicating limits, and then incorporating these boundaries (and/or breaking them) with Digital Fabrication methods and tooling; ultimately providing a platform in which students begin to understand and incorporate project efficiency.

A series of assignments will help students move from general interests in vast topics, to charting a focused, rigorous research process that builds on existing knowledge and attempts to develop new ideas and advances the discipline.  Students will begin to identify precedents, key readings and a research bibliography, an overview of the general topic they will research in depth, a detailed plan for a year?s worth of independent thesis work, and a well-defined end-product, likely a design proposal.  An important task will be to identify advisors who can support, guide, and critique your work, who can act as intellectual collaborators as much as evaluators.

Thesis is an opportunity to develop skills, thoughts, and habits essential for future success, including mental discipline; independence of mind and judgment; working with advisors;  the capacity to focus and pursue a subject in depth and over an extended time;  the ability to design and execute a complex project; the skills of analysis, synthesis, and clear writing; and the self-confidence that grows from mastering a difficult challenge.  Thesis topics and research agendas are generated by the student, but must be determined in collaboration with an advising team, and approved by a Thesis Coordinator.  The School seeks to encourage an expansive range of rigorous and provocative inquiry as a culminating experience for the B.Arch education, including work that speculates, invents, or improves on existing ideas, practices, or systems through research and design; work that challenges the boundaries of the discipline and the profession, and moves beyond mere practice or solution-based work; worj that engages with open-ended and generalizable ideas, as much as with specific situations; work that projects or imagines a better future and an improved world;  work that leads to the new knowledge, ideas, understanding, or paradigms.  Acceptance into Thesis is dependent on passing the <a href="/search/?P=48-497" title="48-497" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '48-497');">48-497</a> ?Thesis Prep? course or its pre-approved equivalent, and submitting a rigorous thesis proposal to the Thesis Coordinator in late August, before the begin of classes.<br />

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />There is a creative core in people which is much more closely related to the hand than to the head. This core is universal and is the source of the connection that all people can feel with something well made. It is the source of an intrinsic meaning that handmade objects have and that all people understand. This class will attempt to connect the inexperienced maker with the universal meanings that emerge in objects made by hand. It will teach you to trust your eye, hand, and intuition which is the substance of self-reliance. Constructing an object from scratch provides deep personal satisfaction. This furniture studio will seek to generate form in direct response to the material, guided by the capabilities of machines and tools available, while responding to ergonomic considerations. The emphasis will be on the use hand tools and power machinery. There will be two main projects for the semester. A table made of straight components and a student selected piece made of curved and shaped parts. Students will conduct a surveys of modern sculptors and furniture to understand the context of studio furniture. The studio will require hand labor in drawing, design and fabrication. Computers may be used to assist design to ease the labor, but the final rendition of the design will be hand drawn full size on ply. This will serve to establish important links between hand and eye/mind, perception and intuition, touch and understanding, The development of these connections between body and nervous system must be established, practiced and reinforced through repetition. It promotes muscle memory that is so essential in all sports and performance skills.

<dd>Spring: 6 units<br />Green building and sustainable design have been rapidly gaining acceptance in all sectors of the building market. Global issues of energy use, emissions, resource depletion, and land use are forcing building professionals to re-evaluate standard design and construction processes, and look to more environmentally friendly practices. The U.S.Green Building Council (USGBC) developed green building rating systems entitled Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDTM) in order to define "green building" by establishing a common standard of measurement. LEED considers green building methods and technologies in several categories including site, water, energy, materials, and indoor air quality, and awards points towards an overall green building rating of certified, silver, gold or platinum. Currently, LEED registered projects make up 3% of the current U.S. commercial building market, and Pennsylvania is the third leading state with LEED registered projects. There is now a demand for design professionals with knowledge and experience not only in sustainable design but specifically with the LEED rating system as well. This course will provide students with background knowledge of the USGBC, the LEED system, as well as referenced standards related to specific topics. The course will benefit greatly from the large number of LEED projects in the Pittsburgh region, which will serve as case studies. Upon completion of the course, students will be prepared to take the LEED Professional Accreditation Exam, which is quickly becoming the standard of recognition for green building professionals.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=48-315" title="48-315" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '48-315');">48-315</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">60-280 Introduction to Contextual Practice</dt>
<dd>Spring: 10 units<br />For some time now art has moved out of gallery and museum spaces and into all facets of public life, where complex social situations and diverse audiences have become important parts of the work. In the past this might have been called Public Art, but today new strategies are being used that challenge public art?s tradition of static sculptures and embrace more dynamic forms of public engagement. As its name implies, Contextual Practice embraces the context or social conditions in which an artwork exists as part of the material of that work. Evolving out of the history of site-specific, conceptual, and performance art practices, Contextual Practice covers a range of exciting new methods to making art in the public including street art, interactive social media, environmental art, hacktivism, participatory art, guerilla performance, project-based community art, and urban interventions.   Students in this field-based class will create projects that work with the social dynamics of a variety of on and off-campus and online public contexts. We will research new trends in public engagement through art, architecture, and design, as well as politics, ecology, sociology, and economics.  Fundamentally, this class asks students to experiment with how their art practice can intersect directly with the real world (outside of the traditional art venues) and how they can proactively create new sites and audiences for their work.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 10 units<br />Photography's unique relationship with reality is the source of the medium?s tension as well as its creative potential. This class will explore photography's tenuous status as a vehicle for truth and interrogate the mysterious rift between the "real world" and photographic representation. Students will be introduced to historic and contemporary practices, from "documentary style" images to abstract formalism. We will examine the history of art photography utilizing the book form with an emphasis on how meaning is created through the photographic series and sequencing of images. A series of slideshows, readings, and discussions will provide a framework for conversation and critique of student projects. Recognizing photography as a conduit for examining our ideas and experiences of the world, students will be expected to conceive, execute and present photographic projects that articulate a deeper understanding of the potential of photographic communication and will encourage a closer look at the photographic illusion as it appears in our ever expanding digital image-sphere.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The leading artistic position of the French Avant-Garde in the 1910's and 1920's was partly predicated on the assembly, meeting,collaboration and cross-influence of artists from all over Europe. The visual artists, musicians and performers brought with them specific aspects of their native heritage, therefore contributing to the enrichment of the general cultural scene. Paris with its cultural focal point the Ballets Russe became a melting pot of creativity.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">60-347 Global Perspectives for Art</dt>
<dd>9 units<br />We find ourselves in a constantly intensifying global reality where increasingly there is a tendency beyond traditional boundaries. This seminar will explore the aesthetic concepts of the large historic cultures where there are bodies of articulated aesthetic philosophy: Western traditions from Plato to Heidegger, including Islam as integral to the Abrahamic/biblical traditions; the vast and rich array of aesthetic thought in Hindu, Buddhist, and Shinto cultures.  In some specifically interesting cases, we will explore particularly small, isolated or ancient cultures, such as the Hopi or the Aborigines of Australia.  In each case, we will explore ideas related to cardinal cultural 'objects' of each culture: architecture, painting, sculpture, performance/ritual, dance, film, and other media.  We will expand our thought through various appropriate readings and discussions.    Research themes can include:  iconoclasm, cultural cooption, cultural orthodoxies and purifications, cultural transferences, cultural isolation and extremes, multiple cultural exchanges over long periods of time, cultural antagonism, cultural extermination and genocide, cultural transplantation, cultural destruction and warfare, cultural distinctions, etc.  Of particular interest will be the study and understandings of the roots of the iconoclastic, anti-art traditions and their constant struggle and interaction with the meanings and power of the icon, symbol and image.  Students will be expected to do specific presentations based on research topics as well as our readings. A final research paper/project will be the major outcome of the course, and in some cases, this will be combined with an artistic project or performance.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />For decades anthropologists have been "picturing" others, in images as well as in words.  This course explores the turn-around: when those who have been subjects of description take the opportunity to represent themselves. After a brief history of visual anthropology, we will concentrate on modes of representation developed by indigenous peoples.  We will explore the meanings of "indigenous," in connection with various modes of representation, including film, dramatic performances, art, and the Internet.  During the semester, we will compare-across time and space-the purposes for which media are used, the transmission of cultural values in media, the organization of production, and the intended audience. Anthropological method and theory will guide our inquiries. Course materials include disciplinary readings, documents dealing with indigenous rights, and examples of the work of indigenous peoples.<br />

This course will take place on campus, and at the Mattress Factory, where I am curating an exhibition, "Feminist and&#8221;", which will open September 7th. The course will cover themes such as the gendered nature of culture; the practices of history and criticism; the interrelation between feminist  activism and art practice; notions of the aesthetic and if there are feminine or feminist aesthetics and representational forms; body, sexuality and representation; the representation of gendered national and racial identities. It will do this through looking at artworks, and through close readings of texts. Some of the material will engage with sensitive issues and challenging images, particularly around sexuality, and students taking the course must be prepared for and accepting of this.

We will consider the historical evolution of the city as both an actual &amp; theoretical entity. The class will explore urban environments in terms of economics, demographics,political, cultural production &amp; psychology &amp; the city of Pittsburgh will function as our site laboratory. We will inquire about the function of public art?what happens when space is required for the public realm for a means of cultural production that aims to yield some form of transformative effect for the ?public? or citizens at large. Moreover the term "public" is an important topic to be investigated: Who is the public? Who is the audience? This interdisciplinary course will consider &amp; examine the interplay of artists &amp; their public &amp; how certain belief systems of a society at a specific time are able to influence a culture's perception of art. What is the role of the artist, critic, curator &amp; urban planner in relation to the public &amp; what is at stake in utilizing public space as a platform for art &amp; other forms of cultural production? We will reflect on why have we become in recent times so preoccupied with public space as a platform for cultural production. Changing attitudes among artists &amp; in museums have played a role in this cultural shift &amp; theory. We will query a range of cultural mediums in order gain insights into the construction of public culture. The means to inspect the varied issues will go beyond assigned readings: it will include class discussions, personal reflections, writings, videos &amp; guest speakers from the field of architecture, public policy, art, &amp; public art. A conjoint class student project will take place to further probe this subject.<br />

What does Satyajit Ray's "Pather Panchali" (1955) share with Mark LaPore's "The Glass System" (2000)? By examining an array of films from the classic days of International New Wave Cinemas, beginning with French Nouvelle Vague, Indian "Parallel Cinema," as well as German, Italian and Japanese innovations and moving to contemporary (and experimental) film movements in Iran, Korea, Hong Kong, Eastern Europe, and the US, we will explore the ways a handful of young directors found novel ways to fund and shoot their movies in direct defiance of commercial, narrative, and cultural norms. By focusing on mise-en-scene over thematics, on-site locations over studios, lesser-known actors over box-office idols, and small production teams over professional crews, these directors were able to turn lo-fi aesthetics and financial shortcomings into a radical new filmic style. Especially central here will be how forms of cinematic experimentation translated internationally--and how these approaches continue to challenge hegemonic forms of media culture.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The arts and their making is a behavior that differentiates our species. Artistic/aesthetic differentiation is a global phenomenon occurring since the dawn of our species.  This seminar will explore the articulated aesthetic philosophy of large historic cultures: Western traditions from Plato to Heidegger, including Islam as integral to the Abrahamic traditions along with the vast and rich array of Hindu, Buddhist, and Shinto aesthetics.  These broader traditions may be examined along with additional examples from small, isolated or ancient cultures, such as the Hopi or the Aborigines of Australia.  Across cultures, we will explore the aesthetics of cardinal cultural "objects" (architecture, painting, sculpture, performance/ritual, dance, film, and other media) through readings and discussions.  Each student's individual definition of the nature of the arts will be constantly measured with and against the ideas of other cultures, all developing an interactive and integrative dialogue.  Other issues include: the study and understandings of the roots of the iconoclastic traditions and their constant struggle and interaction between the meanings of the icon and the image; the notion of cultural "otherness"; and how aesthetic problems manifest themselves in our world in immediate and violent ways; and the evolution of the drive for the preservation of cultural memory in light of recent destructive events in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">60-375 Art History/Theory: Contemporary Likeness, Identity and Culture</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The issue of identity in the visual arts emerged in a new light with the shift from a modernist to a postmodernist paradigm since the mid 20th century. When we speak of identity, what do we mean? How does cultural identity contribute to the formation of personal/private identity & vice-versa? How is this reflected in an artist's work in this time? This class will examine the evolution of human portrayal from the time of Andy Warhol to present. Through readings, discussion & presentations the class will focus on how identity & human portrayal has evolved over time & how theory, popular culture, the cult of the 'glam celebrity,' & technology have played an influential role in reshaping the concept of human portrayal & identity-each challenged the hierarchical pretext regarding the portrait & images of likeness in our culture today. Thanks to photography & cyber-technology no longer is a portrait revered as a unique or rarefied object but a conglomeration of cultural influences. We will look at the works of a diverse range of artists, as well as non-artists, & consider how media affected the evolution of the portrayal of the human face & creation of persona.  Images of individuals were once viewed as a primary indicator of national identity, social status, religious belief, as well as a signifier of historical events influenced by particular ideologies. Nowadays images of the self and others, prompt viewers to consider a wide range of psychological, spiritual, & political information beyond visual manifestation. Two basic questions "Who are you?" & "What is art?" often come together in the contemporary portrait. Most portraits are negotiations between identity & representation, between being a subject & portraying a subject.  Representations of people represent a mark of contemporary life that personal identities have become fractured, complex, & splintered, and that they are in a state of constant re-definition.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 10 units<br />This hands-on and highly interdisciplinary studio course is an introduction to the use of Max/MSP/Jitter, a visual programming environment for controlling interactive music, audio, video, and many other electronic media. For more than 25 years this software has been used by artists, musicians, and stage designers to create their own custom programs for algorithmic compositions, interactive installations, live environments and real-time performances. The simple visual interface of Max/MSP/Jitter allows non-programmers to create their own software without having to learn or to write traditional "code". Instead, users connect together pieces from a vast library of functional objects that manipulate and control sound, video, and other effects (such as DMX lighting) in response to sensors like cameras, microphones, game controllers, MIDI devices, and custom electronics. Students will be exposed to the fundamentals of multimedia programming in Max, the basic building blocks of sound and video, and techniques for integrating data from external sources, such as the popular Arduino microcontroller. They will also gain the practical knowledge and problem-solving skills to develop and design their own interactive installations, sculptures, and instruments for performance-based art or experimentation.

<dd>Intermittent: 10 units<br />This course introduces students to the theories, practices, aesthetics and communities surrounding the design, building and performance with hybrid interactive instruments.  We espouse an expansive definition of the word instrument that includes "a device for the production of sound/music", as well as "a means whereby something is achieved, performed, or furthered" (from merriam-webster.com.  We study the process of translating gesture into another sensory medium (e.g. sound or light).  Our approach to instrument design will depart from the double meaning embedded in the notion of composing instruments: first, consideration of instrument building as an act of composition; second, instruments that compose of their own right.  While emphasis is placed on musical instruments, course work will also encompass instruments that produce light, image, movement, etc.   This course unfolds in two phases: literature review and individualized projects.  The first half of the course will introduce students to a wide range of existing examples from contemporary music and composition, installation art and human-computer-interaction.  Students will study theoretical and computational frameworks for working with gesture in instrument design.  Topics of interest include: gesture data acquisition, data analysis, and mapping gesture data to hybrid-software-hardware computational systems that generate sound/image/movement.  We will investigate the software and hardware technologies underlying the design and fabrication of hybrid instruments with electronics, sensors, signal processing, digital fabrication.  The second half of the course will allow teams of students to choose an area of specialization, design and fabricate a functioning instrument.  The course culminates in an event where all students demonstrate their final instruments in a performance setting.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 10 units<br />This interdisciplinary course will consist of a combination of chemistry lecture & labs with studio art & art history. The focus of the course will be on the intersection of painting practice with chemistry, particularly in the study of pigments of mineral & inorganic origin. This is a project course open to majors in chemistry & art. The course & its projects are designed to expand the expertise of students in each discipline, while exposing them to the methods, demands, & aims of the other.     Historically, the craft of painting was closely linked to the practice of pigment manufacture, with painters procuring their materials in raw form directly from the chemist/apothecary, & often performing themselves the final purification & grinding of the minerals into pigments. Color has been used by both artists & alchemists as a benchmark for tracking changes while creating new materials based on minerals found in nature. With the advent of mass-produced & marketed art materials in the nineteenth century, the distance between chemist & artist increased until the two worlds have little to do with one another. This class aims to reconnect the two disciplines for a study of their common ground. Students will learn about the origin of the color of minerals with primary focus on colors that originate from electronic transitions & will work collaboratively on hands-on laboratory research projects that involve the synthesis, characterization, & use of inorganic pigments. In the studio, they will make their own egg-tempera paints, & use them in painting projects designed to increase color skills as they learn about the history of pigment use. Students will collaboratively design & carry out final projects which combine research, experimentation & creative work. A series of researchers who work at the boundary between art & chemistry will give guest lectures, & the class will make field trips to local research labs & museums.<br />

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />This course provides an overview of design history from 1850 to 1950, the critical period for the formation and development of design and the design professions. There are three primary goals. The first is to provide an understanding of the role that design has played in the evolution of the competitive free market system at national and global levels. The second goal is to demonstrate how design emerged as a powerful tool for corporate and cultural identity in this period. The third goal is to develop an understanding of some of the basic influences on the formation of design theory and practice in the twentieth century. This is accomplished through the presentation and discussion of primary economic and cultural forces, philosophical ideas, artistic and social movements, and significant individuals and artifacts that represent the period.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Stop. Look around you. Where are you and what are you doing? Are you in a lecture hall? A gallery? The check-out line at the "O"? How does the layout of the space support the activity that's supposed to happen there? How big is the space, and how is it proportioned? If you added ten feet to the ceiling height, how would it change the way it feels? Look down at your feet. What material are you standing on? Does it feel soft beneath your feet? How does it affect the sound quality of the room? Imagine it as a bright orange surface. What if the walls were rough instead of smooth-how would they catch the light differently? Does the sunlight come into the space, casting shadows? Or it the light primarily artificial, and what are the fixtures like? What, in sum, does it feel like to be in this space and what are the elements that define it?    This course will present you with the opportunity to consider some of these questions, and will allow you to look at spatial issues from your perspective as a designer. The semester will be divided into sections exploring issues such as program, site, structure, material, and light, and each section will be supported by a series of exercises, lectures, and short projects. Designing Spaces should be of particular interest to those interested in pursuing exhibit design, interior design, and wayfinding design, but it may also be useful simply as a way of expanding your design framework.

<dd>Intermittent: 4.5 units<br />DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE REAL WORLD   Photographers are active observers. They look until they see what they want  others to see -then they compose and click the shutter. In this course  students will walk streets with their cameras. They will learn how to use their   cameras  to better understand what they believe is important, beautiful, and/or   intriguing in the world. They will also learn how to communicate their imagery   to others through screen-based and print output. Assignments range from accurately   describing reality, to showing aspects of life that should be improved, to making   images for purely aesthetic reasons. There are two main goals to this course:   learning the fundamentals of operating a digital camera and producing digital output;   and, learning to become better 'seers' in the world.

<dt class="keepwithnext">51-321 Photographic Narrative</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Most photographs tell stories. We see photographs in newspapers, magazines, snapshot albums, on the web, in books, and in posters. In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles. Photographs can work without words, too, to create purely visual narratives. In this course, students will make a photo narrative and determine how it will be seen.  Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen digitally on screen. While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photographic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who construct fictional worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, and Gregory Crewdson. As students make their own narratives, we will look at the interplay  between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create rhythm; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives. 12-15 students.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Drawing From Nature  This course is about observing and making images of  things growing, crawling, flying, swimming etc. Observations will be made firsthand in the field, supported with relevant research in topic areas with the aim of deepening personal understanding of all things biological. Issue surrounding natural forms such as behavior, locomotion, adaptation, the environment and systems will also be investigated. We will work in tandem on refining our abilities in communicating what we discover through the process of drawing. A variety of visualization methods will be covered i.e. analytical drawing, visual notes, and diagramming to name a few. We will be using a variety of basic drawing and digital media to develop our work as we uncover aspects of form, structure and surface. Guest speakers will present work they have done in areas such as botany, biology, and environmental studies to name a few.  A majority of the work will be done in the field and will then be developed in the studio. A final project will be assigned that will challenge you to develop a concept along with a compelling form(s) that communicates what you have uncovered about nature to a variety of audiences.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Visual notation is the graphic equivalent of taking written notes. While the camera is a valuable and at times indispensible tool for recording what we see, the camera cannot make visible mental concepts. Nor can it discover and display underlying structures, create hierarchies, explain organizational schema or concepts that are not easily seen or understood. This course is about making visual notes in order to become fluent in your abilities to observe, record and interperate. Through daily entries in a journal you will work in several content areas i.e. mapping, natural and built environments and systems to name a few. A good portion of the work in this class will be conducted in the field using the resources available to us such as the museum, zoo and architectural sites. You will also be challenged to incorporate your notes as tools for communicating design concepts, implementing project development and presentations. The course will rely on the use of a variety of simple drawing tools and electronic media. Several visualization methods will be introduced and the work will build on the drawing experiences from First Year drawing. This course is intended for Junior and Senior Design Majors.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />As a society, we're inundated with enormous amounts of dense    information on a daily basis. In fact, many of us have grown so    accustom to the abundance of information in our lives that we expect    and need it to be accessible virtually anywhere and anytime.    Technological advancements, which seem to develop at lightning speed,    continuously provide us with tools that make it easy for us to access    information quickly. However, little is being done to aid people's    understanding of information that is increasing in complexity. Why?    Our addiction to accessible and thorough information has caused many    of us to turn a blind eye to the perceptual problems associated with    its speedy delivery.    In this course we will investigate contemporary visualizations of    information and the bearing of their forms on the quality of    communication. We will also study how peoples' perception of content,    interaction with others, belief systems, and mental and physical well    being can be affected by the visual communication of information.    Thus, although we CAN represent information various ways we will ask    how SHOULD it be designed to aid people's understanding of it. Your    explorations will take the form of analyses of existing artifacts;    class discussions and exercises; short, relevant readings that    originate in various disciplines such as cognitive science,    architecture, learning science, and design; and corresponding projects    that enable you to illustrate what you're learning.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />As design problems become more complex, conceptual modeling becomes critical in design process, especially when designing for the abstract concepts such as interaction, experience, service, and systems. Creating conceptual models are often an important step for making the creative leap from user research findings to design implications, which is one of the core challenges in design process. Conceptual models are also effective tool to bring in shared understanding for different stakeholders in teams with multidisciplinary team members, user-participants, and clients. Moreover, these conceptual models often directly lead to final information products to support users to learn how to use complex systems.     Conceptual Models is a full semester course that provides students with the opportunity to explore theories related to conceptual models and to improve skills in using them as a means of design. Being primarily developed for graduate and undergraduate students in Design, this course consists of two parts. The seminar part of the course will provide students with readings, examples, and in-class discussions to help them understand the nature of conceptual models. The project part of the course will provide an opportunity to apply these theories to actual projects. Students will work in individuals and teams to create conceptual models for different needs and goals in design process.<br />

Fast forward to today, where hundreds of brands and thousands of styles can be browsed online, shipped in 24 hours, and returned if less than perfect for free. The shoe purchase experience relies on system of services and products to satisfy one's needs and desires for new shoes. In this course, we will collectively define and study services and product service systems, and learn the basics of designing them. We will do this through lectures, studio projects, and verbal and written exposition. Classwork will be done individually and in teams.

It explores philosophies and anthropologies of sharing, distinguishing sharing from giving, lending and exchanging. It interrogates psychologies and histories of ownership, and notions of privacy. The course also explores the range of new systems that promote sharing in the contexts of the new sociality enabled by the social media and cosmopolitan urban living. It investigates the role of politics, such as concerns about ecological sustainability, and the role of perceived autonomy and convenience. By the end of the course, you will have a more comprehensive understanding of what facilitates and constrains sharing, and so be in a better position to design systems that promote increased resource productivity.

Even if we don't think of ourselves as photographers, digital cameras make it easy to photograph our families, our trips, and aspects of our life that we want to remember. But beyond snapshots, can photography also teach us how to see? And how do they teach us about the world? And, what are the qualities inherent in photographs that make them effective as artifacts of communication? Does looking through the camera's viewfinder sensitize us to world and help us see more? Or, as some writers suggest, does the camera interfere with experiencing the world fully.  This course explores seeing with the camera and the many issues that arise when one snaps the shutter. We will be looking at a range of different kinds of photographic images, understanding their contexts, and how to read them. Designers and other visual people use photographs extensively in their work. This course endeavors to make students more aware of their decisions and actions when making photographs as well as how to judge a photograph's effectiveness. The issues that we discuss using photographs, relate to other kinds of visual images, as well. We will be making photographs as we are discussing critical issues in photography that come out of readings.

<dt class="keepwithnext">51-423 Pieces 2.0: Social Innovation: Desis Lab</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />In this class, students will identify a social problem and take a holistic design approach to solving it. They will design a product/product line-anything from a set of tools to help older adults lead a more active lifestyle, to re-envisioned collateral for the Lupus Foundation Pennsylvania. After or in tandem with the creation of this product, the student will construct an image, which will entail print media, a Web presence, packaging, and photography. By creating the product and its "marketing" effort from top-to-bottom, the student will gain a diverse set of skills in design as well as a richer understanding of the product. In the end, all the pieces will come together to create a well-refined image.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Students will be required to plan and design projects that relate to binding, or digital printing, or letterpress printing, or hand-setting of cast metal type. Projects utilizing a combination of all processes can be planned as well. Experimental work, or Artists' Books are also encouraged. In this class structure students will be able to plan and design projects that are complete books, with printed content, or with out content. Other flat structures, and three dimensional containers are examples of general forms that will be categorized as binding work. Students who wish to enroll in this course must have already taken Beginning Book Arts, and must also speak to the instructor directly about project ideas.  Emphasis for binding is working independently with a greater level of hand craft and a sensitivity to materials.  Emphasis for letterpress printing is to learn in depth, and master, the general mechanical process for doing press work.  Emphasis for hand typesetting is on gaining an understanding of the system of cast metal type, and to develop a sensitivity to typographic principles.  Instruction will be given on an individual basis through consultation at strategic times throughout the semester. Project evaluation will be based on the success of the project work compared to each student's written project proposal at the start of the semester.  The Advanced Workshop in Book Arts can be repeated.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The Experimental Form Studio looks broadly at the discipline of industrial design with an emphasis on creating new paradigms for interactive objects. This course encourages an exploratory study of physical objects and artifacts and provides a creative and intellectual forum to re-imagine our relationship with objects. Each independently-themed project presents opportunities to consider embedded mechanics &amp; technology, objects as interactive media, and experience-driven design.   Experimental Form, at its most basic, is a process that blends play and inquiry in an open-ended way   finding the unexpected through tinkering and trying something you don't quite know how to do, guided by imagination and curiosity. In this course, there are no instructions, no failures, no prescribed right or wrong ways of doing something. In this sense, Experimental Form complements the core ID Studio sequence by providing a playground for intellectual discourse, experimental trial and error, and refining individual processes for designing. This is your sandbox. Prerequisites: Junior standing in industrial design or MPD.  Junior level communication design, MTID, MDes with instructor permission.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">51-435 Presentation &amp; Pitch Design</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 4.5 units<br />Presentation &amp; Pitch Design:    The premise of the course is to provide design students with the fundamental tools to effectively present and pitch their designs. The foundation of the course is best explained by Dick Buchanan he states, "The designer, instead of simply making an object or thing, is actually creating a persuasive argument that comes to life whenever a user considers or uses a product as a means to some end." (Buchanan, R. 1985) I am looking to enter into a dialogue with undergraduate and graduate design students based on the notion of creating a "persuasive argument" to their design presentations. More importantly, I am looking to facilitate skill development using narratives as a medium for design students to present and pitch the intent of their designs based on five core principles.    intentional positioning (empathize with your audience)  restraint in preparation (concise structure)  simplicity in design (visual congruence with design artifact)  clarity in rhetoric (know your message)  naturalness in delivery (be yourself)    Upon completion of this class, students will have mastery in the Five Core Principles mentioned. They will be able to:    Identify and cater to their audience's needs  Empathize with their audience and adjust accordingly  Craft a narrative that captures their design intention(s)  Visually compliment their design in their presentation  Clearly develop their message (pitch)  Develop and present in their own style.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Services constitute more than 79.2% of the US economy. The service sector has been increasing substantially while the commodities and manufacturing sectors have experienced a steep decline. Yet, service providers have historically under-utilized design in its business strategy and development.      During this project course, intended to work in conjunction with Designing for Service Seminar, we will extend the idea of design as more than aesthetics and provide the opportunity for students to practice embodying its perspective and process, mapping design theory to project process. Students will spend the semester in teams, working with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to deeply understand their users and stakeholder's experiences, needs, and desires. We will explore the role of journalism and news in society, the volatile sector as a whole, and the challenges facing newspapers in America. The human-centered design approach will employ ethnographic research methods, allowing for teams to uncover insights and observations about patterns. Students will in turn learn to synthesize these findings into appropriate models, prototype concepts, and look for opportunities. The design solutions are intended to inform elements of the paper's competitiveness, creativity, development and future service innovations. The final deliverable will be refined solutions as illustrated in a presentation and process document.&#160;.<br />

<dd>4.5 units<br />This course is an opportunity for students to study how user research applies to concrete design projects in an organizational context.  We will study three different design projects that pursue a human-centered design approach: The Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) Transformation Project by the United States Postal Service, the Australian Taxation Project by the Australian Tax Office, and the Income Tax Form Redesign by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States.  Students will trace the role of user research in each case.  The class will take the format of a seminar with lectures, presentations and readings.  Together with actual samples from the three case studies, they will provide a background for rich discussions.  Students will walk away with three key insights into applied user research: They will understand how user research applies to a complex system, such as an organization.  Simultaneously, students will gain an understanding of the opportunities and the potential pitfalls that arise when co-designing with a client.  Finally, By studying the design process and the artifacts that were developed by these three projects, the contribution of user research in designing interactions of individuals with organizations, the effect of user research on an organization and the role of user research organizational change will become evident.    Open to graduate and advanced undergraduate students in design.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />DEXIGN THE FUTURE: Human Centered Innovation for Exponential Times  As corporations, governmental organizations, and civil associations face accelerating change in uncertain times, increasingly they are looking to designers for new ways of thinking and acting. Designers today are engaged as thought leaders, strategists, activists, and agents of change in complex socio-technical problems throughout private, public, civil and philanthropic sectors worldwide.      For designers trained to shape futures defined by uncertainty and change, these exponential times represent unprecedented creative opportunities for innovation. In this course, students explore methods and tools for design in exponential times to shape uncertain futures. Students will explore the forces that drive change in the future (i.e., social, economic, political, environmental, technological), and learn to align innovation strategically with the trajectories of those forces.  The design project that drives everything else is the future of mega-metropolitan regions, the hubs of innovation where 70% of people in the world and 75% of Americans will live in 2050. In the semester long project, students create scenarios for Life 2050 in Metro 3.0, using Pittsburgh as a locus and focusing on a project within urban systems such as Sustainable Production &amp; Consumption, Lifelong Learning, Human Development and Resilient Community.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Design Methods:  Analysis and Creativity    Most designers recognize that "process" is an important part of  professional practice, yet the "methods" that try to capture design  process are varied and often conflicting.  The goal of this course is  to explore design methods and their supporting techniques, seeking a  better understanding of the pattern of inquiry upon which they are  based.  The course will include a close reading of works in the  "design methods movement" of the 1960s and 1970s.  This movement  rightly occupies a central place in the development of design methods  and methodology in the twentieth century.  It is at times insightful,  at other times confusing and dissatisfying.  Nonetheless, it is  essential to understand what was attempted and actually accomplished  by individuals such as Bruce Archer, John Chris Jones, Horst Rittel,  and Christopher Alexander.  Our current understanding of design  methods, including the new forms of user research, is grounded on  their work.<br />

In the first half of the semester students wear the half-masks of the archetypal Commedia characters (Harlequin, Pantalone, et al), to learn their psychology and physicality, improvise on historical and contemporary scenarios, and apply Commedia technique to modern comedy.  Commedia dell'Arte gives them the tools to tackle physical comedy from any era, past or present.  In the second half of the term students discover their personal Clowns.  This clown has nothing to do with the American Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus clown; this is not a character or caricature, but rather a revelation of the clown each student hides under the mask of adulthood. Discovering this clown gives them all a way to laugh at themselves, to uncover what makes each individual uniquely funny; it also lets them see how we only laugh at truth and in the personal material lies universal humor.  Inside this freedom is the technique to know what's funny and why, and the ability to apply these rules in comedy.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=54-107" title="54-107" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '54-107');">54-107</a> and <a href="/search/?P=54-108" title="54-108" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '54-108');">54-108</a> and <a href="/search/?P=54-207" title="54-207" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '54-207');">54-207</a></dd>

This material is valuable in how it contextualizes the kind of work students will be involved in, and helps to drive home the very real consequences of errors pertaining to scenery.  In the classroom and in lab students in this course will develop their knowledge and processes for building scenery.  The course has three basic units.  The beginning of the semester focuses on building materials and on tool use.  Through the center of the semester course material focuses on traditional scenery practices.  The end of the semester material addresses rigging systems and scenery rigging practices.  Laboratory assignments tied to this course will consist of carpentry assignments in the shop and carpentry and rigging assignments during load in.  Occasionally students pursuing a more customized path may have lab assignments in the paint department in the shop and in the electrics department during install.

<dd>Fall: 6 units<br />FUTURE STAGES is a graduate level course (Drama undergraduates by permission only) which combines options from the School of Drama in a new configuration: through working collaboratively across disciplines, students investigate multimedia approaches to contemporary theater and new ways of storytelling. Directors, designers, actors, and dramaturgs work in groups to generate original ideas, images, texts, and material in a workshop environment. These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations.  The emphasis is on process, not product &#8212; devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development &#8212; both of which are explored here.    We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included:  Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more.  Students learn to define and distinguish these artist's approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion.   This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each student's individual discipline. We focus on the process of creating a theatrical language which truly integrates disciplines.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=54-301" title="54-301" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '54-301');">54-301</a> and <a href="/search/?P=54-302" title="54-302" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '54-302');">54-302</a></dd>

 <h6>Note on Course Numbers</h6> <p>Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix which designates the department offering the course (76-xxx courses are offered by the Department of English, etc.). Although each department maintains its own course numbering practices, typically the first digit after the prefix indicates the class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore level, etc. xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or graduate-level, depending on the department. xx-7xx courses and higher are graduate-level. Please consult the <a href="https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet" target="_blank">Schedule of Classes </a>each semester for course offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.</p>

<dt class="keepwithnext">57-109 Elective Studio (Guitar Class)</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 3 units<br />Using classical and jazz guitar methods, this course is designed to provide a basic set of techniques that will allow students to pursue the avenue of guitar playing that most interests them.  While emphasis will be on developing skills in playing the guitar, a basic understanding of the principles of music theory as applied to the guitar will also be acquired.    While few students will find it possible to master all of the materials presented, an exposure to the many possibilities of musical expression available on the guitar and an understanding of basic music theory will help to broaden the students' perspective and make future musical experiences, such as listening and performing, more rewarding.    Each student is expected to have his/her own instrument.  A guitar in good working condition is essential.  An acoustic classical or steel string is preferred, an electric with a small battery operated amp is acceptable.    Students having no previous training on the guitar will find this class most valuable.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">57-343 Interdisciplinary Studies in Listening, Culture, and Technology</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The proliferation of portable as well as computerized audio technologies has radically changed the way the human beings listen, consume, and produce music and sound. With the emergence of "cloud" storage services like Dropbox, Amazon, and Google you can effortlessly store and share music files anonymously or with friends. Services like Facebook, Pandora, Spotify, Last.fm, Amazon, and iTunes use finely tuned algorithms to make musical recommendations and in the process further personalize your experience as a consumer of music. All of these services, many of which are virtual, have come to mediate our intensely personal and communal experiences with music. The Listening Spaces seminar seeks to understand the overwhelming impact these mediating technologies have had on our social, political and personal interactions with music. Foundational readings will include Jonathan Sterne's MP3: The History of a Format, Alexander Galloway's Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture, Trebor Scholz's Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory. The seminar will be focused around developing and completing critical projects that cross technological and humanistic boundaries.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Music cognition is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the mental processes that support musical behaviors, including perception, comprehension, memory, attention, and performance. Like language, music is a uniquely human capacity that arguably played a central role in the origins of human cognition.  This course is survey of current approaches to and theories about the perception and cognition of music. Topics covered include psychoacoustics; the cognitive neuroscience of music; relationships between music and language; the nature of musical knowledge; and debates about aesthetics, evolutionary psychology, and musical universals.        At the end of this course a student should be able to identify key theories and hypotheses in music cognition as they relate to memory, emotion, physiology, neurology, acoustics, language, and evolution.  They will be able to comparatively evaluate hypotheses and place them in an intellectual context.  These objectives will be achieved though critical reading, discussions, and written exercises.        There are no prerequisites for this course. It will be helpful for you to know some basic elements of music theory (such as the names for chords, Roman numerals, and so on), but some extra help will be available to cover these topics.

In this course, we will survey this trajectory by viewing and analyzing eight repertory staples:    Wagner   Parsifal  Debussy   Pell&#233;as et M&#233;lisande  Puccini   Turandot  Berg   Wozzeck  Gershwin   Porgy and Bess  Britten   Peter Grimes  Messiaen   Saint Fran&#231;ois d'Assise  Reich   Three Tales    We will also become acquainted with other works related to these staples, from Strauss to Saariaho and Tan Dun, and ask numerous questions. What can these operas' characters and techniques tell us about late modern subjectivity? What happened to the great national traditions? In what musical styles has opera flourished and languished? How have audiences changed? How has the notion of opera itself changed, from the nature of its heroes and heroines to its performance forces and media?     The goals of this course are to 1) promote intimate knowledge of the eight core operas; 2) encourage familiarity with numerous related opera plots, opera composers, and twentieth- and twenty-first-century musical styles; 3) broaden literary and musical analytical tools to include historical, aesthetic, and (multi)cultural perspectives on opera; and 4) improve oral and written communication skills about opera.    Requirements: Attendance at opera screenings, readings, quizzes, small written assignments, and a 17  to 20-page research paper on an opera of your choice written since 1850.      Required text: Mervyn Cook, ed. The Cambridge Companion to Twentieth-century Opera (2005).<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=57-284" title="57-284" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '57-284');">57-284</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">57-413 The Interpretation of Music</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 6 units<br />What does it mean to "interpret" music? How does performance differ from interpretation? How do we distinguish a good interpretation from a bad one? To answer these questions, this course examines Metaphor, History, Influence, Meaning, Analysis, Performance, Musicology, and other concepts, applying them to works like the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto, Chopin's Fantasie Impromptu, Beethoven's "Ghost" Trio, and Debussy's "Voiles." Our readings draw mainly from Lawrence Kramer's Interpreting Music (2011). Our goal is to appreciate the complexity and nuance inherent in the process of music making and to formulate our individual values in the interpretation of music.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">57-414 Music and Nature</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Musicians and philosophers have long explored the rapport between music and nature, tracing music's origins alternatively to nature and human culture and defining nature differently according to their time and place. This course will examine the opposition between nature and culture through both musical compositions and philosophical writings. We will study theories of the origin of music (from Lucretius to biomusicology), theories of music that seek justification by appealing to nature (from Boethius to Grisey), and theories that question whether natural sounds can be music. We will also examine musical representations of place, weather, and animals through the perspectives of ecocriticism and notions of the pastoral.  : Repertory will include Vivaldi's "Spring" Concerto, Beethoven's "Pastoral" Symphony, Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung, Mahler's Symphony No. 3, and Debussy's La Mer. We will compare landscapes by Sibelius and Copland, birds by Dvorak, Bart&#243;k, Ravel, Stravinsky, and Messiaen, and whales by Crumb and Hovhaness. We will also treat statements on the environmental crisis by composers Harrison Birtwistle, Philip Glass, Peter Sculthorpe, and John Luther Adams.  : Reading, listening, discussion, 2 short papers, 1 long paper, oral presentation.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=57-285" title="57-285" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '57-285');">57-285</a></dd>

<dd>Fall: 6 units<br />In the genre with the highest stakes and the highest failure rate, Mozart composed the earliest operas to have staked a permanent place at the center of the repertory. This course seeks to account for his success, to explain why he succeeded where others failed and what has made his operas beloved for over 225 years. We begin with a brief overview of all of Mozart's operas and discuss the types of opera in circulation in late 18th century Austro-Hungary, especially opera seria, opera buffa, and Singspiel, and the pressures that shaped the music and libretto of each production, from the type of patronage to the style of recitative. Then we examine The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and The Magic Flute at a pace of about one act per class session, looking at poetry, dramaturgy, stagecraft, acting, performance practice, character development, theme, and politics, always through the filter of Mozart's music, especially its melody, reform elements, blurring of genre and affect, vocal counterpoint, use of topics, and musical symbolism.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=57-285" title="57-285" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '57-285');">57-285</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">03-115 Phage Genomics Research</dt>
<dd>Fall: 6 units<br />This course will provide an introduction to biological investigation through a research project in bacteriophage genomics. Genomics combines experimental and computational approaches for large-scale analysis of the biological information contained in DNA sequences. The ability to analyze the complete DNA of any organism has revolutionized modern genetics and is influencing many areas of biology and medicine. The most abundant biological entities are bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). Their enormous diversity and number make bacteriophages important models for the study of gene structure, function and regulation, population genetics and evolution. In addition they are the source of important tools in biotechnology. The research goals of this course will be to identify new bacteriophage species and incorporate them into a comparative genomic study to better understand the genetic organization and evolution of these organisms. While accomplishing these goals students will develop an understanding of the research process, including the ability to design experiments and interpret novel data.    Fall semester: Samples will be collected in the field. From these samples students will identify and purify bacteriophages. The bacteriophages will be characterized structurally by electron microscopy, and their DNA will be purified and sequenced.<br />Corequisites: 03-110 and <a href="/search/?P=03-121" title="03-121" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '03-121');">03-121</a> and <a href="/search/?P=03-151" title="03-151" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '03-151');">03-151</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">09-122 Molecular Tools for Biological and Chemical Studies</dt>
<dd>Spring: 6 units<br />The increased fluorescence of certain molecules, also known as dyes, can signal their binding to a specific biological target such as DNA. This phenomenon finds important application in the biological and medicinal field where dyes are used as molecular tools. For example, fluorescent dyes can be used to detect the expression of a gene; survival of cells; site of accumulation of a metabolite and many of them are used in diagnostics. This course is aimed at offering a hands-on laboratory experience in the interface of chemistry and biology, so called bioorganic chemistry. The student's project will be to prepare a dye, thiazole orange, that will show increased fluorescence upon binding DNA or a protein, thus, signaling the binding event. A dye designed to prevent DNA binding will be tested alongside to highlight how molecular design works. Molecular size and geometry are important elements in the design of molecules that specifically bind biological targets; 3D molecular modeling software (freeware) and hand-held models will be used to analyze how these factors play a role in target-dye interaction.<br />

<dd>12 units<br />Bioorganic chemistry is concerned with the action of synthesized compounds on biological systems.  In order to maximize the likelihood of identifying a biologically active compound, synthetic libraries are often employed, requiring extensive familiarity with simple, efficient chemical coupling steps and protecting group chemistry.  In this inquiry based laboratory course, using a process that mimics the current practice in drug discovery by pharmaceutical companies, students will rationally design a compound library in hopes of finding a compound active against a selected biological target, search for active compounds in the library, and then quantitatively characterize any identified compounds for activity.  Working in small groups, students will develop proposals for and execute the target assay selected, the library synthesis, and the screening approach.  Students will write reports summarizing the results in each phase of the course.   Throughout the course, students will be introduced to concepts relevant to industrial scientific research, including regulatory compliance, quality control and assurance, and intellectual property.<br />Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=09-218" title="09-218" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '09-218');">09-218</a> or <a href="/search/?P=09-220" title="09-220" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '09-220');">09-220</a>) and <a href="/search/?P=09-222" title="09-222" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '09-222');">09-222</a></dd>

 <h6>Note on Course Numbers</h6> <p>Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix which designates the department offering the course (76-xxx courses are offered by the Department of English, etc.). Although each department maintains its own course numbering practices, typically the first digit after the prefix indicates the class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore level, etc. xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or graduate-level, depending on the department. xx-7xx courses and higher are graduate-level. Please consult the <a href="https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet" target="_blank">Schedule of Classes </a>each semester for course offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.</p>

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This is a first course for those considering majoring or minoring in Computational Finance. The theme of this course is pricing derivative securities by replication. The simplest case of this idea, static hedging, is used to discuss net present value of a non-random cash flow, internal rate of return, and put-call option parity. Pricing by replication is then considered in a one-period random model. Risk-neutral probability measures, the Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing, and an introduction to expected utility maximization and mean-variance analysis are presented in this model.  Finally, replication is studied in a multi-period binomial model. Within this model, the replicating strategies for European and American options are determined. 3 hrs. lec.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=21-112" title="21-112" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-112');">21-112</a> or <a href="/search/?P=21-120" title="21-120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-120');">21-120</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">33-224 Stars, Galaxies and the Universe</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The study of astronomy has blossomed over the past few decades as a result of new ground-based and space-based telescopes, and with the advantage of fast computers for analysis of the huge quantities of data. As our astronomical horizon expands, we are still able to use the laws of physics to make sense of it all. This course is for students who want to understand the basic concepts in astronomy and what drives astronomical objects and the universe. The course emphasizes the application of a few physical principles to a variety of astronomical settings, from stars to galaxies to the structure and evolution of the universe.

Observational cosmology continues to enjoy a golden era of discovery and the latest observational results will be interpreted in terms of the basic cosmological parameters.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=33-224" title="33-224" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '33-224');">33-224</a> and <a href="/search/?P=33-234" title="33-234" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '33-234');">33-234</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">33-467 Astrophysics of Stars and the Galaxy</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The physics of stars is introduced from first principles, leading from star formation to nuclear fusion to late stellar evolution and the end points of stars: white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. The theory of stellar structure and evolution is elegant and impressively powerful, bringing together all branches of physics to predict the life cycles of the stars. The basic physical processes in the interstellar medium will also be described, and the role of multi-wavelength astronomy will be used to illustrate our understanding of the structure of the Milky Way Galaxy, from the massive black hole at the center to the halo of dark matter which emcompasses it.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=33-224" title="33-224" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '33-224');">33-224</a> and <a href="/search/?P=33-234" title="33-234" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '33-234');">33-234</a><br />Corequisite: <a href="/search/?P=33-341" title="33-341" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '33-341');">33-341</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">33-650 General Relativity</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />General Relativity is the classical theory of gravity. It is widely recognized as a beautiful theory - equating gravity and the geometry of spacetime leads to a profound conceptual change in the way we regard the universe. The predictions of the theory are relevant to systems as varied as high precision measurements of the earth's gravitational field or the strongly curved space-times around black holes. In this course, we will gradually develop an understanding of the geometries which are the solutions of the Einstein equation, with an emphasis on their relevance to physical situations. We will motivate the theory step by step and eventually introduce the Einstein equation itself.

<dt class="keepwithnext">38-210 BIOSSS: Biotechnology Impacting Our Selves, Societies and Spheres</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 6 units<br />The biotechnology era has begun and its impact is being felt at multiple  levels that range from individual effects to global concerns.  Vocabularies  are expanding to include words such as stem cells, genomes, SARS and anthrax  while hearts and minds are grappling with related issues such as human  cloning, DNA profiling, epidemic control and bioterrorism. Emerging  infectious diseases have no respect for national boundaries and challenge  our knowledge, resources and personal well-being.  Understanding and  responding to such personal, societal and global challenges requires a level  of scientific literacy currently deficient in much of the general citizenry.  In addition, scientists of the future must be able to apply their  disciplinary knowledge within the context of relevant ethical, legal and  societal influences. "B.I.O.S.3: Biotechnology Impacting Our Selves,  Societies and Sphere is a course on biotechnology literacy and decision  making in a global context. The guiding framework of the course curriculum  design is centered on an application of the principles of the central dogma  of biotechnology. The approach can be described as the "transcription" of  core knowledge into context followed by the "translation" of that knowledge  into global perspective and personal action. The course will involve the  development and implementation of core topic modules. The first module  piloted will focus on HIV/AIDS.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">38-709 Applied Cell and Molecular Biology</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />This course will examine applications of modern cell and molecular biology, with emphasis on commercial products and processes.  The course will include a basic background in the major topics that would be covered in courses on prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecular biology and molecular cell biology.  The course is intended for non-specialists who seek an understanding and appreciation of fundamental concepts without the analysis of experimental detail that would support the development of concepts in a course for the specialist.  The course will draw on the patent literature as a source of commercial applications of biological discoveries.  Examples of the topics that might be included are: diagnostic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (e.g., Herceptin), therapeutic proteins (e.g., colony stimulating factors, erythropoietin, hormones), antibiotics, subunit molecular vaccines, amino acid fermentations, enzyme based processes for chemical synthesis, gene therapy, stem cells and regenerative medicine, herbicide tolerant plants, microbial diagnostics (e.g., multilocus sequence typing), transgenic animals, DNA fingerprinting.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">38-710 Principles of Biotechnology</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br />This course is intended to provide an introduction to a set of core areas currently highlighted in the biotechnology industries. The objective is to provide the appropriate background for management level personnel to optimize their decision-making based on knowledgeable background in today's technologies. The focus will be on weekly modules of similar technologies with an introduction to technology/science behind the topic area and the applications of the technology in today's industries and markets.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">38-801 Evidence Based Teaching in the Sciences</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 7 units<br />Special Permission Only: This course is designed to prepare PhD students from science disciplines to: (1) teach effectively and efficiently as future faculty members; (2) critically read and apply peer-reviewed, STEM-based educational research; and (3) adapt approaches from the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) to formatively assess student learning and iteratively improve teaching and course design.  Together, we will explore the research on teaching and student learning, identifying and challenging our assumptions regarding how college students learn best in science disciplines.  Participants will leverage this research to cultivate a diverse toolkit of evidence-based, student-centered strategies for teaching and course design that may be applied to face-to-face, blended, or online courses, both within and across STEM disciplines.  Prior teaching experience is not required, but students must have completed their first year of PhD study to enroll.  This course will not prepare or license participants to teach K-12 students in Pennsylvania or elsewhere.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-100 Reading and Writing in an Academic Context</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br /><a href="/search/?P=76-100" title="76-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-100');">76-100</a> is an academic reading and writing course for multilingual students, especially those who are not native speakers of English or who consider English to be their weaker language.  The course, designed as a prerequisite for <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a>, emphasizes reading comprehension strategies for reading a variety of text types in English (e.g., journalism, textbook selections, popular press arguments, and academic journal articles). Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers' expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels.  Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers.  Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF).  Each <a href="/search/?P=76-100" title="76-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-100');">76-100</a> course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-101 Interpretation and Argument</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br /><a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a> introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a> is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a> course with intellectual curiosity.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Spring 2014: This course will explore at least two of the meanings of the word "matters"?as in "is of importance," and as in "things, concerns". Through reading and writing in various genres, students will discover and discuss how creative writing engages with the world around us while also learning some of the important techniques of writing creatively. The class will read a number of books by authors in various genres, and students will have the opportunity to interact with these authors through public readings and classroom visits. In addition, the class will take advantage of other literary events happening around Pittsburgh in order to further engage with places where writing comes off the page and engages with the world. Revision will be required and emphasized.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-144 English Freshman Seminar: College Novel</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Fall 2014: In the first chapter of one of the most notorious college novels, Stover at Yale (1912), Dink Stover imagines the glories that await him when he arrives: ?They had begun at last ? the happy, care-free years that every one proclaimed. Four glorious years, good times, good fellows, and a free and open fight to be among the leaders and leave a name on the roll of fame. Only four years, and then the world with its perplexities and grinding trials.? The freshman of 2014, however, confront mounting student debt, accounts of gruesome college shootings, pressure to succeed from parents and peers, as well as the distractions of video games, college parties, and the internet. In this course we think about how we got here through the genre of the college novel, from the best selling classic, F. Scott Fitzgerald?s This Side of Paradise, to Zadie Smith?s On Beauty, to the best selling Pittsburgh based novel, Wonder Boys, by Michael Chabon.<br />

Fall 2011:  What does it mean to be Indian outside of India? How is it possible to "live in the hyphen" as both British and Pakistani? In this course we will look at the writings and experiences of South Asians (people from the Indian subcontinent), living in such places as the United States, Britain, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and East Asia, who construct what Salman Rushdie calls "imaginary homelands." We will examine the histories of migration and study how the experience of living between two continents has been theorized. In addition to examining the diaspora's past, the course will investigate present day South Asian Diaspora cultures including popular culture, film, music, dance, art, theater, and literature. Possible readings include works by V.S. Naipaul, Salman Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri, Hanif Kureishi, Meera Syal, Vijay Prashad, and Michael Ondaatje.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-213 19th Century British Literature</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Spring 2012: Women writers played an essential role in the construction of Victorian literary culture. In this course we will read novels, poems, and periodical extracts by a diverse body of nineteenth-century female authors as a means of better understanding women's historic and aesthetic impact on Victorian culture. While some of our authors are well known, like the wildly popular poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, we will also encounter the 'lost' author, journalist, and controversial anti-feminist Eliza Lynn Linton. The writing of Victorian women exemplifies important social debates from the nineteenth-century. Social taboos such as divorce, suffrage, Bloomerism, children out of wedlock, and women in the workforce were all topical in Victorian culture. As the conflicted and introspective heroine of George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss reminds readers, the role of marriage as a woman's sole profession was becoming increasingly untenable in the modern era. Victorians were forced to ask what other function were women fit to occupy. From the Pre-Raphaelite poetry of Christina Rossetti, to the gothic horror of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, "the woman question" served as a lightening rod for a variety of nineteenth-century cultural anxieties. The woman as deviant and criminal which we will encounter in Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret was an especially controversial aspect of the female-dominated genre of "Sensation Fiction." Margaret Oliphant records in an 1867 review from Blackwoods: "What is held up to us as the story of the feminine soul as it really exists underneath its conventional coverings is a very fleshy and unlovely record.(See Dept. for full desc.).<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Consult the course descriptions provided by the department for current offerings. Example, Spring 2010: In this class, we will be reading many of the major works of  Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville. Often described as America's Dark Romantics, these three authors are frequently read as reacting to the current of optimism and idea of human perfectibility that characterized antebellum America and the Transcendentalist movement. We will begin by reading most of Poe's short fiction and novellas and a number of his poetic and journalistic works. We will also read Hawthorne's two major novels House of the Seven Gables and The Scarlet Letter, as well as a number of his shorter works from Twice-Told Tales. The class will also look at a number of Melville's major works beginning with his first novel Typee, his short story collection The Piazza Tales, and culminating with Moby Dick. In addition to reading these canonical authors for their artistic merit, we will also consider the ways in which their works interacted with some of the prevailing ideas of their historical moments.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-217 Contempory American Literary &amp; Cultural Studies</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Consult the course descriptions provided by the department for current offerings. Example, Summer 2010. It has been said that the teenager is the most free and least happy of all living beings. Given America's current obsession with youth culture, it's hard to imagine a time when the word "teenager" did not exist. However, this word came into being largely as a result of the post World War II boom in consumerism when advertisers needed a new way to define an emerging demographic group with its own disposable income and spending power. Through a survey of twentieth century literature that focuses on the teenage experience, we'll explore the changing meanings of young adulthood over the last one hundred years. What is the relationship between the invention of the teenager and modernist aesthetics? What characteristics were considered markers of young adulthood in the 1920's? In the 1950's? In 2000? How are the experiences of angst, anomie and the unfulfilled American dream connected to modern Western life through the teenage subject? How do tropes of individualism, rebellion, freedom and resistance connect the literature of teen angst with other genres of American literature? How has teen angst been both an impediment to and the inspiration for cultural resistance and social change? To answer these questions, we will compare texts such as Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint, Anzia Yezierska's The Bread Givers, J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, Margaret Atwood's The Edible Woman, Dave Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, and Banana Yoshimoto's Kitchen.

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-221 Studies in Classical Literature: Books You Should Have Read By Now</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />It may seem more and more difficult to get a good classical, liberal education these days. The demands of professional training force many of us to skimp on our understanding of major artistic achievements. So, this class is for those people who should have read some of the best books around, but haven?t managed to yet?books you should have read by now. Kurt Vonnegut?s character Kilgore Trout sings the praises of Dostoevski?s The Brothers Karamazov, (and the same thing might be said about Crime and Punishment) pointing out that it contains everything you need to know about life. He then ruefully adds that unfortunately that?s not enough anymore. It may not be enough, but it might be a place to start. Each book will be considered in itself for whatever it might offer by way of understanding the world, the past, the present, ourselves and others. Finally we shall use the idea that literature is equipment for living as a way of understanding and evaluating our experiences. Or: what use is it to have read some of the so-called ?great books? of the Western canon? A recurrent interest will be in improving our language ability in general as we consider various books of central importance to our cultural traditions.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-225 Topics in Rhetoric: Words and Numbers</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Spring 2014: For decades, communication researchers relying on stimulus-response theories associated a text with a single dominant stimulus evoking a single dominant response. This thinking widely influenced rhetorical understandings of language for decades as well. Today, rhetorical theories of language have discredited these behaviorist theories in favor of theories that see language as the constructors of situations rather than the effects of them. When speakers and writers use language, they resuscitate, enact, and perform worlds of experience from words. They create not only meanings but histories, identities, and social bids to initiate social change. This course introduces students to a theory and ontology of language study that is in keeping with language as a constructive activity.  Students will learn to use software designed to analyze texts qualitatively and numerically from a constructive point of view. The software works as a microscope to help you see patterns of language use that escape the limited attention span of even the most painstaking of close readers. After learning how the software works, we will do exercises with small textual samples so that students can sharpen their powers of observing language across families of patterns. Students are encouraged to analyze the texts they love most -- from literature, politics, journalism, to their favorite blog posts, tweets, and Facebook posts.

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-227 Comedy</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />We can't, of course, expect to come up with an absolutely complete definition of the comic, but for our purposes we can consider it as an embodiment of the opposite of "gravity." Comedy is characterized by its levity.  This does not mean, of course, that it is any less "serious" than tragedy, even if-or especially-because it tends to favor the superficial over the profound. Indeed, if tragedy is adolescent, then the mature, adult mode is the comic, being more social and rational. A key characteristic of comedy is wit-or simply intelligence. Comedy involves a lot of pure play of the mind.  It turns out that there have been a few notable attempts to help us understand just why comedy is the "social" genre beyond all others, why the comic attitude is the civilized, urbane, mature view of life. And we'll consider some of those theories while trying to understand why some things are comic and some are not. We'll consider several classical works of comic literature, beginning with Aristophanes, Shakespeare, and moving on to more recent examples, including some films.<br />

Example, Spring 2012: The purpose of this course is to introduce you to diverse examples of African-American literary expression. You will read canonical works like Fredrick Douglass' Narrative of the Life of Fredrick Douglass, an American Slave, Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God and Toni Morrison's Sula as well as not so canonical but more contemporary works like Aaron McGruder and Reginald Hudlin's graphic novel Birth of a Nation, Kyle Baker's comic-series Truth: Red, White and Black and Paul Beatty's Tuff. Along with these primary works this course will also introduce you to the field of African-American literary criticism. These secondary readings will help you explore the historical, aesthetic and political issues that surround these works of art, give you a sense of how criticism functions and the multitude of forms it can take.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Example, Fall 2010: 20th Century American Bestsellers: In this course we will work to construct a story about the United States and its literary tastes in the twentieth century by reading a selection of bestselling American fiction from the last 100 years. The class will introduce students to concepts central to the cultural study of popular texts, as well as a number of more and less familiar authors and novels. Readings will include only novels that appeared on yearly Publisher's Weekly top-ten bestsellers lists from 1900 to 1975. Winston Churchill's A Far Country, Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence, Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, Sloan Wilson's The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, J. D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey, and E. L. Doctorow's Ragtime are just a few of the novels that have shown up on this list. To complete our sketch of popular contemporary fiction, students will present on a bestseller from the last three decades and its reception. Moving through the wide range of texts that became bestsellers, from Wharton to Dan Brown or Stephen King, will allow us to consider whether Daniel J. Boorstin really got the whole picture when he said, "A best-seller was a book which somehow sold well because it was selling well." Course requirements will include a midterm exam, a presentation, and a final paper based on the presentation, as well as intensive reading.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics will vary by semester. Spring 2013: When we reflect on the role of media in our lives, we ought to consider both their meanings and functions. Media objects like advertisements, newspapers, and television shows all have various meanings for audiences, but they also serve central - and sometimes very different - functions in our economy, our democracy, and our everyday lives. The course will offer students a survey of various ways of understanding media objects, including aesthetic, formalistic, ideological, and economic approaches media. Students will practice their interpretation by encountering media objects like the classic 1939 propaganda film The Middleton Family at the New York World's Fair, simultaneously a scandalous love story, a reassuring American myth, a piece of self-serving public relations for the Westinghouse company, and a determined apologia for capitalism produced at the height of the New Deal era. Other visual media that we will analyze will include films like Network (Sidney Lumet, 1976) as well as smaller-scale objects like advertisements and internet "front pages." Interpretive and critical secondary texts will feature works by scholars like Theodor Adorno, Marshall McLuhan, John Berger, Raymond Williams, Noam Chomsky, and Mark Crispin Miller.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

In the first half of the semester, we will look at the early moments of cinema, tracing the historical development of film form and narrative while investigating the incipient theories that sought to define its methods and effects. Working primarily through Bordwell and Thompson?s seminal text, Film Art: An Introduction, we will also learn the grammar and various approaches to analyzing film. Additionally, we will trace the rise of the Hollywood studio system, understanding and situating its dominance during its ?golden age? by watching movies that both represent and challenge the ?classical Hollywood? mode. In the second half of the course, we will survey several national cinema movements, such as Italian Neorealism and French New Wave. And alongside a wide range of international films, we will consider many of the dominant strains within film theory, e.g., discussing auteur theory and watching an Ingmar Bergman film. To finish class, we will define the place of the big-budget, hybrid-form ?blockbuster? in our increasingly global and interconnected context, interrogating the current state of the movies and movie going.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

We will consider the ways in which gender operates in intersection with categories such as race, class, sexuality, religion, and nationality in global contexts. The course readings will also address how gender as an analytical category is redefined and transformed in an era of globalization, post humanism and new materialisms. We will use keywords and concepts acquired from academic sources to critically analyze themes of gendered performance and representation in literature, film, and television in a range of spheres such as family, culture, work, law, ecology and technology.

In 1878, Andrew Carnegie left his growing steel empire to sail around the world.  Content to leave his business, he was not content to leave his 13-volume set of Shakespeare's complete works. He later wrote: "I have read carefully eleven of Shakespeare's plays during the spare hours of the voyage. They are such gems. I feel as if I have made new friends, whose angel visits will do me good in days and nights to come...everything has its environment, and Shakespeare is the environment of all English-speaking men."     Much has changed since Carnegie wrote those words, but many still hunger for an introduction to Shakespeare's Tragedies and Histories like this one. Our reading list will include hauntingly powerful plays such as Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear, Henry V, Richard II, 1 Henry IV, and Henry V.  Students at the end of the course should expect to have a good grounding in the language, themes, and characters of Shakespearean Tragedies and Histories and perhaps more importantly be equipped to think carefully about Shakespeare's plays in relation to poetics, topical politics, and genre. In addition to regular short writing exercises of varying types, assignments will include one close reading paper, a longer research paper, and performance of a scene.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-247 Shakespeare: Comedies and Romances</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />Most of Shakespeare?s comedies were written early in his career. The laughter they provoke is both festive and satirical, and they end in marriages. The darker (but more fantastic) plays we call romances were among the last drama he wrote. In this course we will be working out close readings of six very different representatives of the genre comedy and two from the genre romance. We will try to see these plays: 1) in relation to the culture for which they were written and which they helped shape--the newly established public theater in London, prevailing notions about social class and gender, Puritan attacks on play-going, and the like, and 2) in terms of "what's in it for us"?how current audiences and readers can enjoy and interpret these plays.  We will be considering what the plays have to say about the authoritative institutions and discourses of their time, and how they address us now that those institutions and discourses have been replaced by others.     On Mondays and Wednesdays the whole class will meet together, and smaller discussion groups will be held on Fridays. Students will be required to attend and participate regularly, submit brief responses on Blackboard, bring brief written analyses to discussions, write three prepared essays, and take a final exam.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />According to The National Endowment for the Arts, creative nonfiction is "factual prose that is also literary." Memoir, the essay, and literary journalism are just three kinds of writing that fit into this very broad, very vital genre. While creative nonfiction often borrows techniques from fiction, such as narrative, scene, dialogue, and point of view, creative nonfiction is based on actual events, characters and places. What distinguishes creative nonfiction from journalism is that it conveys more than bare-bones facts and that language, analysis and narrative voice are integral parts of each piece. In this course, students will have the chance to read widely within the genre. Exercises and writing assignments will give students the chance to write their own pieces, so that by the end of the semester, everyone will have written four different kinds of creative nonfiction.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Poe defined the short story as something that could be read at one sitting. While simple enough, the definition in fact suggests a concern with concentrated form and unified artistic effect. In a sense, the short story has been around as long as people have been telling each other tales, but as a literary form it came into its own in modern times, during the 19th century, and it continues to be produced in considerable numbers. For many readers one of the great features is the one Poe pointed to, it is short. People who have never finished a novel by Henry James must be legion. So, with the short story, we can experience something with genuine literary merit, in an accessible form. Concentration, of course, can bring issues of comprehension and often short stories can seem puzzling, or incomplete to the average reader. This class will attempt to develop our abilities to read with care and attention--and feeling--in order to make us better readers of any artistic text. The challenges of the short form turn out to be excellent opportunities for learning a lot, in a little space. We?ll make use of several inexpensive anthologies, and look at one or two central writers (Hemingway and Borges) in more depth. The class will require the writing of a few short papers, engaging in online discussions on Blackboard, and three in class tests.  Students can expect to develop their historical understanding of current experience and to gain an understanding of how to interpret and comment on significant pieces of fiction. They will become familiar with some key ideas about the nature of short stories in general and the interpretation of texts., and will engage in an attempt to develop a theory of the aesthetic nature of short fiction.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

While such expectations exist, practice in this genre of writing, particularly in the personal statement, is not always readily available in existing coursework. "Presenting a Public Self" will introduce methods for developing and practicing your ability to communicate individual proficiencies and aspirations in written form, while bringing you in contact with a body of published work by public intellectual figures from the U.S. and other territories whose writing demonstrates an intertwining of personal narrative and public, professional identity, to engage readers of all stripes.   Throughout the term you will practice writing in the public yet personal vein through assignments like: self-portrait essay, to cultivate a first-person voice, an op-ed essay, to practice balance in argument from the position of a burgeoning expert in your disciplinary area, and a personal statement, where you will learn to combine articulation of a personal narrative and professional competency to argue why you are a strong candidate for a particular opportunity. Reading selections for the semester will include work produced by your peers, as well as published writers whose work combines personal and professional spheres, ranging from texts like Paul John Eakin's Living Autobiographically to Mary Catherine Bateson's Composing a Life to Spencer Nadler's The Language of Cells: A Doctor and his Patients, amongst others.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-324 Topics in Rhetoric</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />In this course, we will study communication strategies of effective leaders -- people who seek to promote change in various professional, political, or cultural contexts. The main goals of the course are to understand rhetorical challenges that leaders face in different fields, to examine the language they use, and to learn (through theory, analysis, and practice) the most effective rhetorical strategies that can empower a leader. By drawing on the literature from management, organizational communication, psychology, and rhetoric, we will address a set of questions that include: (1) What makes an effective leader? (2) How do leaders use language and for what purposes? (3) What rhetorical strategies can be most useful to leaders to achieve their goals? (4) What is the role of creativity in leadership, and especially in the leader's use of language? We will mine the literature on leadership for theoretical insights on rhetoric. Students will be expected to lead discussions on readings, a midterm that synthesizes the readings, and a final project that reviews the literature and provides an annotated bibliography in some subfield of rhetorical leadership.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics will vary by semester. Fall 2014: What do we mean when we say that someone has ?twisted? our words, or that our words have been ?taken out of context??  Why is Martin Luther King Jr. best remembered for saying, ?I have a dream,? and not for saying, ?War is the greatest plague that can affect humanity??  What are political ?talking points? and how are they perpetuated? How does a claim (unfounded or not) become a fact?  How does a fact become a myth? These are just some of the questions that we will consider. More specifically, this is a course in how meaning changes as texts created in one context and for specific purposes are repeated, cited, and used in other contexts and for other purposes, sometimes related and relevant, sometimes not. More technically, we?ll be focusing on the rhetorical nature of intertextual discourse.  Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kinds?including politicians, journalists, and scientists?strategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed.  Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends.  More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable.  Ultimately, you will conduct your own research on intertextual rhetoric on a topic of specific interest to your academic or professional goals.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics will vary by semester. Spring 2014. Beginning with Aristotle?s definition of rhetoric as the faculty of observing the available means of persuasion in a given case, rhetoric has been closely associated with cases. Like Aristotle, during the past century rhetorical theorists including Kenneth Burke, Chaim Perelman, Stephen Toulmin, and Thomas Sloane have remarked on the close affinity between the rhetorical method and the casuistical one?based on analogical reasoning from paradigmatic past cases?and some have even proposed that we model a theory of argument on the case-based reasoning found in Anglo-American legal systems. In this course, we?ll explore the casuistical or case-based method of argument commonly used in law, business, and public policy schools and in various moral and ethical contexts including medical and bioethics, as well as the case study research methodology frequently used in the social sciences and practice-oriented disciplines such as law, business, and education. Alongside various examples of cases and case-based arguments, we?ll read rhetorical and interdisciplinary scholarship discussing the casuistical method, the relationship cases bear to general rules, theories, and principles, the role of ideology and narrative in case construction, and claims that case studies are invaluable for their ability to represent the unique qualities of a person, group, or situation. Students will write a series of case-based arguments of 3-4 pages each which will be combined into a portfolio or single paper by the end of the semester, demonstrating the ability to use cases in various forms of writing and argument.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

EXAMPLE: Fall 2011: Renaissance scholars sometimes promote the misconception that Shakespeare was the first writer to create characters with inner lives (rather than just social roles), that he was the inventor of the human, as Harold Bloom puts it. The varieties of writing-from the 700s to the 1400s-we will take up in this course will, I think, challenge that view. Some of the texts in which medieval men and women represented themselves are reflective, some are outrageous, some are charming, some are funny-all are populated by human beings we can recognize in spite of unfamiliar modes of presentation. We will explore both well-known fictions like Beowulf, The Song of Roland, Dante's Inferno, and Malory's Morte Darthur, and some not so well known. The lives of women in the Middle Ages will be a particular focus for the course.

EXAMPLE: X-Files of the Seventeenth Century.  Ghosts, monsters, prodigies, demons, and other strange phenomena:  many of these so called "preternatural" occurrences were becoming the object of overlapping (and sometimes conflicting) forms of explanation during the seventeenth century.  Whereas some of these phenomena could be explained philosophically - with reference to natural causes - others belonged to religious debate or seemed exclusively to exist in the imagination.  Using a broad range of texts, we will examine the widespread interest in the preternatural in seventeenth century culture, exploring the political, religious, and ideological consequences of this fascination.  Texts for the class will include images of natural "marvels" and "monstrosities," collections of "curiosities," plays by William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, utopian fiction by Margaret Cavendish, selections from Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene, seventeenth century crime pamphlets, philosophical texts by Francis Bacon, Robert Hooke's images from the microscope, readings in Renaissance and classical poetics, and various religious texts.

But while early hard-boiled crime fiction was typically written by white authors and focused on white protagonists, African Americans soon found the genre particularly appropriate to depict their long experience with systemic racism and economic exploitation in the U.S.  In this class, we will explore how African-American authors like Richard Wright, Chester Himes, Walter Mosely, and Paula Woods appropriated the hard-boiled crime novel over the 20th Century to represent the effects of racism and economic inequality on the black community and American society and, in doing so, developed the genre into a unique expression of African-American history and identity.  We will also examine how the African-American crime novel is taken up by other cultural mediums like film and, more recently, the graphic novel to create new ways of expressing the genre.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

But what does it mean to be "post-race?" Where does this concept come from? Is this a good thing? Does being "post-race" mean the same thing to everyone? How does being post-race differ from multiculturalism? In order to explore these questions we will read or watch works such as Phillip Roth's The Human Stain, Jeff Chang's Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation, Barack Obama's Dreams From My Father, Toni Morrison's A Mercy, Paul Haggis' Crash and Timothy Chey's Fakin da Funk.

One quarter of the nation's transportation companies went bankrupt, as did nearly 20,000 businesses. Unemployment reached 14%. Four years later it was officially declared a "depression." When did all of this happen? Was it 2009? Or the 1930s? No, it was the depression triggered by the financial panic of 1873. Out of this period, also known as the "Gilded Age," came a unique strain of American literature. Frank Norris's grisly tale of an overbearing dentist and his miserly wife, McTeague, Andrew Carnegie's autobiography, Upton Sinclair's iconic The Jungle, Edith Wharton's tragic love story House of Mirth, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's feminist utopian novel, Herland, William Dean Howell's capitalist satire, The Rise of Silas Lapham, Theodor Drieser's mournful Sister Carrie-all of these writings react to, and try to shape, the economy of a century ago. These novels, which were often critical of corporate capitalism, give us a rich and detailed picture of the last time in the US that Americans suffered under the kind of gap we have today between rich and poor. In the US today the top 1% controls 42% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 80% controls a mere 7% of the country's wealth.

However, that designation now seems inadequate: writers who became prominent in the immediate postwar era are historically removed, and writers arising since 1980 form a distinctly different generation, with a different sensibility. This course will account for the immediate postwar period, with the working hypothesis that we need to create a new construal of American literature and its recent past.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics will vary by semester. Fall 2012: New media isn't new; old media isn't dead. The term "new media" itself presumes that a wholly original technology replaces another outdated one. This course will trace a history of media change from 1844 to the present day, or, roughly from the telegraph to the iPad, though we will dedicate the bulk of our attention to the mid to late twentieth century. Rather than accept a straightforward linear narrative of innovation, we will, instead, privilege use, reception, and context. The class will also explore various "dead media," technologies that got left behind in the march of progress towards the digital. By approaching the very idea of new media critically, the class intends to deepen students' understanding of both the historical and contemporary position of the digital media we rely upon to interact with the world around us. While the course readings will be comprised primarily of theoretical and historical approaches to media, we will also draw off many primary sources such as science-fiction, classics of American literature from writers such as Walt Whitman and Thomas Pynchon, as well as documents in which technical pioneers such as Alan Turing outline the form and function of concepts and devices that directly shape modern day computing. Since this course will cover multiple forms of media, students will be expected to develop methods to deal with the specifics of each medium. Students will keep media journals chronicling their interaction with various forms of media - new and old - and experiment with a small sample of digital archives and digital production software in order to complete a case study midterm project on an overlooked medium (or aspect of a medium) of their choice.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The source of the Nile, the Antarctic and the Amazonian rainforest were once seen only by adventurers and eccentrics.  Today they can be visited in relative comfort by tourists.  But as the world has grown smaller, our sense of adventure and exoticism has changed.  That change can clearly be seen by examining the ways in which film has dealt with ?the exotic? over the last century.  Early films of stories such as H. Rider Haggard?s She (first filmed in 1911) and Edgar Rice Burrough?s Tarzan of the Apes (first filmed in 1918) have been remade at regular intervals up to the present, with each iteration displaying differences that reflect the social, racial and political constructs of their times.  The same pattern can be seen in film documentaries which progress from the fictionalization of exploration and adventure in films like Chang, Gow the Headhunter and Nanook of the North, to the arguably no less fictionalized accounts of March of the Penguins and the ?Disney Nature? documentaries. In our examination of ways the concepts of exoticism and adventure have changed, we will also discuss events in the film industry which have impacted perceptions in the West.  The post-war internationalization of film culture, for example, reduced or channeled the ?otherness? of locales with thriving industries, while the rise of a globalized market has led Hollywood to de-emphasize or simplify cultural differences.  At the same time, cultural sensitivities have tempered the once common lionization of explorers and adventurers.  Lastly, we will consider the significance of the shift from exploration narratives set in remote parts of the Earth to science fiction stories which take place on exotic worlds beyond our own, as Hollywood attempts to adapt established models to new cultural imperatives.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Ever since the development of radio in the early 20th century, Americans have expected that we would soon all talk alike. The conviction that the media would make us all sound the same revived with the widespread adoption of television, starting in the 1940s, and the development of the internet in the 1990s led to worry about how soon we'd all be writing the same. But fears of the homogenizing effects of the mass media on American English have proven to be exaggerated: Americans still talk and write in many different ways. In this course we explore why this should be. Why don't we all speak alike? Why do we need variation in language? We will explore how regional and social dialects and varieties come to be and what their functions are, and you will learn how to hear, see, and describe varieties of language. We will also touch on American languages other than English. Documentary films and online materials about language will be the basis for another strand of the course, as we work together to explore how linguistic variety can best be represented and explained in non-technical ways, and in a variety of media, for the general public. Reading will be mainly in two books: American English, by Walt Wolfram and Natalie Schilling-Estes (2nd. edition), and Language in the USA: Themes for the Twenty-First Century, edited by Edward Finegan and John R.

While dedicated primarily to poetry, this course will investigate the implications of this intertwining in practice. Seeking to do justice to the true interdisciplinarity of Renaissance poetry, the course supposes that poetry and verse technique mattered so much in the period due to questions spanning art, politics, and theology of how power (verbal power, divine power, political power) should be represented. Biographically, many canonical poets we'll study in the course worked as ambassadors, representing power abroad (Wyatt, Sidney, Donne, Marvell). Many more poets including Shakespeare and Milton thematized diplomacy, in both its divine and more worldly forms ("angel," in fact, means "messenger"). Poetry too was seen in similar terms. As Coleridge would later write, poems were "the envoys or representatives of\205vital passion." Readings including Shakespeare's Hamlet, Milton's Paradise Lost, and John Donne's "The Ecstasy" will be introduced and contextualized through writers such as Pseudo-Dionysius, John Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Alberico Gentili, and George Puttenham. Topics to be considered will include historical poetics, divinity, sovereignty, immunity, license, fidelity, craft, and accommodation.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics will vary by semester. Spring 2014: Dedicated to political and religious poetry in the age of Shakespeare and Milton, this course has two main premises: (a.) that poetry, international politics, and theology were far more intertwined in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries than they are today; and (b.) that angels and diplomats are good to think with.  "Angel," in fact, means "messenger."  The course will try to do justice to the true interdisciplinarity of Renaissance poetry, considering big questions involving secularization and poetry's relations to war and peace.  For instance, are "all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state...secularized theological concepts"?  Is war of humans' making (poesis) or of God's? If we treat angels, diplomats, and poems as early modern media, does the medium change the message? We will also consider questions of craft, technique, and poetics. One hypothesis is that verse technique mattered so much in the period due to the question of how power (verbal power, divine power, political power) should be represented and restrained.  Biographically, many canonical poets we'll study worked as ambassadors, representing power abroad (Wyatt, Sidney, Donne, Marvell). Many more poets including Shakespeare and Milton thematized diplomacy, in both its divine and more worldly forms. Shakespeare considered his sonnets "written embassage[s]." Readings including Genesis, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Milton's Paradise Lost, and John Donne's "The Ecstasy" will be introduced and contextualized through writers such as Pseudo-Dionysius, John Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Alberico Gentili, and George Puttenham.

Gertrude Stein seems to have started the whole generation naming fad with her comment to Hemingway, "You are the lost generation." Paul Fussell identifies the cultural effect of WWI as the production of 'irony' as the central quality of modern identity (Some Beat writers make a similar claim for the effects of WWII). This class is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Beat writers class; it is related in theme but focused on different writers and texts. Students might consider taking this class as a point of entry to 'The Beat,' or might consider this class as a follow-on to 'The Beat' in order to understand more fully some of the central literary and historical issues of our time. In both cases we focus on the intersection between cultural change and major war. The Lost Generation class might include, for example, work by Stein, Hemingway, W.B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, T.S.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Fall 2014: Who is the reader of a text, the viewer of a painting or film, or the spectator of a performance? What does the medium in which a text is presented?the book, or film, or painting, or theatrical performance?have to do with how the text is received, consumed, contested, or appropriated, sometimes or often against the intentions of the author, painter, or performer?   \tThis course studies the long-debated problem of how readers or spectators respond to texts (in print, film, theater or painting) from ancient rhetoric and tragedy to contemporary mass culture.  Aristotle, Plato, Longinus and other ancients theorized about audience response in terms of its danger or advantage to the polis; in that broad sense, the problem has always been political as well as psychological and aesthetic. Eighteenth-century thinkers formulated notions of ?beauty? and ?standards of taste? to measure audience response to poetry and visual art.  Romantic writers developed psychologies of reading as symbolic interpretation.  The rise of mass culture, on the other hand, links the politics of reading or viewing to questions of consumption and the market of cultural goods. Guided by recent critical theory as well as classic questions, we will ask how the reading or viewing subject is ?constructed? by the printed or filmic text; how institutions like schools control the process of interpretation; how individual readers ?appropriate? texts for themselves against their authors? intentions.  Two shorter papers and one longer paper will be required for the course, in addition to a class presentation in the last two weeks of the semester.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Fall 2012: This course looks at the relationship between women and globalization. Globalization has been defined as the "creation of new and the multiplication of existing social networks and activities that increasingly overcome traditional political, economic, cultural, and geographical boundaries." What, then, are the roles and places of women in these new networks and activities? What is the function of the text-fiction, memoir, scholarly article or film-in describing these roles and places? This course will begin exploring these questions historically by theorizing women's relation to the nation in nationalist struggles. We will look specifically at the close connection between women and elements of tradition, including religion. Moving into the contemporary moment, we will examine the experiences of immigrant women and women in the global factory. As a way to interrogate our own assumptions, we will consider heated debates about global feminism. Throughout the course, we will think through the role of cultural representations in these issues.  Readings will be drawn from around the world, and include theoretical works as well as literary and filmic representations.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-355 Leadership, Dialogue, and Change</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Leadership is often associated with the exercise of institutional authority or individual power. However the tradition of leadership based on dialogue shows us a powerful counter-rhetoric-one which organizes people to work together on complex problems through problem-posing, pragmatic inquiry, and the inclusion of marginalized perspectives.   We will examine how this approach to leadership and change works in public voices of writers from Emerson and Martin Luther King, to the community organizing of an Alinsky, to the cultural critiques of African-American and feminist scholars such as Cornel West or bell hooks, and-equally importantly-in the ways ordinary professionals include voices and integrate social values into effective workplace writing, and the ways students call forth change on campuses. This introduction to the rhetoric of making a difference shows how its roots in American philosophical pragmatism created a focus on outcomes, not just ideals, and translated commitments into strategic rhetorical practices.   In this course you will develop your own skills in writing and leadership by working as a "rhetorical consultant" to a campus or community group: learning how to investigate and define a shared problem, to develop a briefing book for deliberation, and to support inclusive decision making by documenting rival perspectives and options (see http://www.cmu.edu.thinktank).

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />We often send the documents we produce out into the world, having worked hard on them and hoping that they achieve the purposes that we intend for them. In some situations, this suffices. In others, however, we may need more than hard work and hope-we may need to know that a document is working: Are thousands or even millions of people going to be using the document? Can they comprehend it? Can they follow its directions safely? Are they fearful or confident as they do so? In Planning and Testing Documents, you will study and practice methods for providing valid and reliable answers to these types of questions, both in the lab-before a document goes out the door-and in the field-after a document is in the world. Learning about the problems readers have using documents can be a rewarding experience for professional writers. And the reasons for doing so are several: Various studies have shown that reader feedback helps professional writers optimize the effectiveness of their documents, that professional writers themselves are unable to predict the problems readers experience, and that writers become more aware of their audiences and improve as writers when they are regularly confronted with reader feedback.  Topics will include both basic issues that pertain to all empirical research methods-sampling, response rates, validity and reliability, the design of questionnaires, scales and surveys, the ethical issues involved in doing research with people-as well as methods specifically relevant to planning and testing documents, such as subject matter expert (SME) observation and interviews, think-aloud usability testing (you'll learn more than the "crash course" basics that you learned in your introductory professional writing course), plus-minus testing method, designing comprehension tests, and other reader-focused evaluation methods.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Literary Journalism is non-fiction writing about the people and places in the world that might be overlooked by traditional journalism. Concerned more with those whose lives are outside of the traditional spot-light, literary journalism enriches our sense of who inhabits the contemporary world. Reading the stories of other lives can help us understand our own, by enlarging and deepening the context in which we understand our humanity. In this class, you will read a variety of professional literary journalism, and be asked to write your own. You?ll have chances to interview people you know, and don?t know, and write their stories, along with an assignment that invites you to capture your family history. You?ll write about Pittsburgh places, and you?ll learn how the stories of your own life can become literary journalism when you learn to contextualize them, and connect them to larger issues.

The focus will be on verbal rhetoric, but students who wish to analyze visual rhetoric interactively with verbal rhetoric will be welcome to do so. In the first part of the course, we will review various methods for analyzing digital texts descriptively (viz., concordance, collocate and keyword analysis) and inferentially, through multivariate analysis (e.g., manova, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis). To learn these methods, in the first half of the course, we will use simple textual data sets supplied by the instructor. In the second half of the class, students will choose their own digital environments to analyze and they will be expected to write publishable-quality rhetorical analyses of these environments. To meet this expectation, students will need to do considerable background research in the digital environments they are studying.<br />

But through the years science fiction has demonstrated its potential to not only explore the powers of science, but to champion political rebellion, question social norms, and give readers an insight into their own possible futures. The best science fiction writers have shown that the genre need not be merely ?pulp? (though it was in pulp magazines that sci-fi first gained popularity), but that science fiction can combine subtle emotion and character development with dazzling intellectual insights. The readings in this class will trace the history of science fiction, starting with Johannes Kepler?s Somnium (considered by many to be the first true work of science fiction), moving through the pulp age and the golden age of sci-fi, and finishing with some exemplary writers working today. Works by H. G. Wells, Robert Heinlein, C. L. Moore, Ray Bradbury, Philip K.

This class will focus on a few novels by writers at the center of the invention of the modern literary world. Our goal will be to sharpen our reading skills and our understanding of a variety of experimental techniques in the novel. Henry James is often thought to be the source of modern ideas about fiction writing and was a powerful influence on all significant writers who followed him. D.H. Lawrence was a passionate critic of traditional novel forms, seeking a form more appropriate to the experiences of modern life. With his collaborator Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad developed the technique known as impressionism, a style intended above all, as he said, to make us see. He is known for the complexity of his narratives and his formal experiments. James Joyce is regarded as having perfected all of the formal possibilities of the novel, effectively exhausting the form. The reading list will include books of this sort: Henry James: The Bostonians, Joseph Conrad: Lord Jim:, D.H. Lawrence Lady Chatterley's Lover, James Joyce: Ulysses, Virginia Woolf: To The Lighthouse (not the actual list, but like that).<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

Through readings, assignments and class discussion, we'll tackle questions such as: What makes a story newsworthy? How does a reporter decide which points to emphasize? What are effective techniques for a successful interview? How does a journalist turn pages of scribbled notes into a coherent news story?  \tWe'll do a lot of writing, but we'll also examine issues and trends affecting journalism today.

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-377 Rhetoric of Fiction</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Wayne Booth's book, The Rhetoric of Fiction, is one of the classic discussions of the ways in which fiction communicates, moves, or motivates us. It is a commonplace to assume that literature has a message, but it is still not at all clear just how an imaginative representation of the world does, or can, communicate. Booth had particular difficulty understanding how fiction could communicate a felt sense of life and value when there was doubt about narrative authority, or the 'reliability' of the author. So, postmodern fiction (from Joyce on) caused him problems. In an attempt to develop a postmodern rhetoric of fiction we shall be looking at texts that deal directly with issues of persuasion, or texts that seem directly to address the reader. Of particular interest will be texts that indirectly implicate the reader, and achieve a kind of implicit rhetoric even when they apparently frustrate normal expectations of communicative language (e.g. the apparent fact that the reader is also a character in Calvino's 'novel' if on a winters' night\205). We'll consider the kinds of problems (and solutions to those problems) caused by excessive irony, by 'showing' rather than 'telling' and by the 'absent author,' in texts like Madame Bovary, Notes From Underground, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, etc.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Literacy has been called the engine of economic development, the road to social advancement, and the prerequisite for critical abstract thought. But is it? And what should count as literacy: using the discourse of an educated elite or laying down a rap? Competing theories of what counts as "literacy" - and how to each it - shape educational policy and workplace training. However, they may ignore some remarkable ways literacy is also used by people in non-elite communities to speak and act for themselves. In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacy - its history, theory, and problems - we will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach. Then we will turn ideas into action in a hands-on, community literacy project, helping urban students use writing to take literate action for themselves.   As mentors, we meet on campus for 8 weeks with teenagers from Pittsburgh's inner city neighborhoods who are working on the challenging transition from school to work.

<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br />In classical rhetoric, "style" is a term that refers not to what we write but how we write. Yet considerations about how we write ? coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance ? can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, "Who is my audience"? and "What is my purpose"? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising writing. Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved ?good? style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

This course provides students who have already learned the foundation of written communication with an opportunity to develop the ability to analyze and create visual-verbal synergy in printed documents. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary, as well as the practical issues of visual communication design through a series of hands-on projects in various rhetorical situations. Assigned readings will complement the projects in exploring document design from historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. Class discussions and critiquing are an essential part of this course.  Adobe Creative Studio (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) will be taught in class, and used to create the assigned projects.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=76-270" title="76-270" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-270');">76-270</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-271" title="76-271" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-271');">76-271</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />As more of the world's texts become digital and systematically classified, scholars and analysts are increasingly able to analyze not only individual texts but also vast collections of texts, or textual corpora. The analysis of corpora becomes especially important when your focus of analysis is the genus rather than the individual and it has hundreds of applications. It is useful when instead of a single Aesop fable, you want to characterize Aesop's fables as a group and you want to compare them, as a group, with, say, the writings of a contemporary poet or the lyrics of contemporary musical artists. Corpus rhetorical analysis is also useful when you want to compare the styles of two columnists or critics based on a large sample of their writings.  It is useful when you want to understand the ?nuts and bolts? rhetorical choices that make software documentation a different professional genre from sports journalism or science writing. This is a hands-on course where students get practice conducting corpus analyses using corpus software and statistical methods.  The course is divided into three parts. In the first part, student will learn a theory of textual segmentation that is behind preparing a collection of texts for corpus study. In the second part, students will analyze corpora provided by the instructor and learn how to write a corpus report.  In the third part, students will compile a corpus of their own choosing with a research question and then conduct a corpus study and submit a report that seeks to answer that question.<br />

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />In this course we will explore methods of researching, writing, and presenting original work in English Studies.  The field of English Studies is profoundly interdisciplinary. We will strive to understand not just traditionally used methods (such as text analysis), but also more recent developments borrowed from other disciplines (such as history and sociology, anthropology, and visual studies). We will cover methods for developing topics, constructing research plans, finding and using scholarly sources and conducting field research, organizing, writing, revising, and presenting a research paper of 20-25 pages.  Students will also learn how to situate their work in the context of scholarly conversation, by testing their hypotheses against alternative and presenting their research to audiences in the field of English studies. Throughout the semester, students will develop and work on an original research project. At the end of the semester, students will give a public presentation of their research to other students and English faculty.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-294" title="76-294" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-294');">76-294</a></dd>

Students will learn how to conduct research on scientific topics using primary and secondary sources, how to conduct interviews, and how to organize that information in a logical fashion for presentation. For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and completely to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science journalists, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearing, a doctor describing the latest research on a disease to a patient advocacy group, or a computer programmer describing new software to his firm's marketing staff. Students will get a chance to read several examples of top-notch science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles - and rewriting them after they've been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works to explorations of controversies in science. Students should expect to see their writing critiqued in class from time to time, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through. The goal will be clarity and verve; the ethos will be mutual learning and enjoyment.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=76-270" title="76-270" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-270');">76-270</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-271" title="76-271" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-271');">76-271</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-372" title="76-372" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-372');">76-372</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-375" title="76-375" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-375');">76-375</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-472" title="76-472" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-472');">76-472</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

What hasn't changed is the need for effective arguments (print and digital) that respond to both the rhetorical situations at hand and the ongoing needs of a specific organization. In this course, designed for students pursuing careers in professional communication, we'll examine the critically important practices of argument and advocacy. And while our central focus will be on non-profits, the arts, education, political advocacy and social causes, the techniques we'll learn are also broadly applicable to communications careers in all sectors. Our main focus will be on how professional communicators design arguments and make media choices consistent with the "voice" of their organizations. Among other questions, we will ask, how can we adapt the genres of mass communication to meet our organization's goals? What roles can social media play in non-profit advocacy, and how are those roles changing? How can we have impact while working with limited budgets? The end result will be a professional portfolio that demonstrates both relevant skills and a high-level theoretical understanding of what makes a public argument successful. Students will also gain experience in translating their technical expertise into language that potential employers understand and look for.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=76-270" title="76-270" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-270');">76-270</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-271" title="76-271" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-271');">76-271</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-272" title="76-272" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-272');">76-272</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-372" title="76-372" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-372');">76-372</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-373" title="76-373" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-373');">76-373</a></dd>

It is particularly appropriate for professional and technical writers, but also a good option for anyone interested in fields that involve substantial instruction, such as teaching or employee training. In the first part of the course, we'll examine the recent history of instructional design and the major current theories. Then we'll take a step back and study the concepts of learning upon which these theories are based, with particular attention to their implications for how instruction is structured. You'll find that different learners (e.g., children, older adults) and goals (e.g., learning concepts and principles, learning to apply principles to solve novel problems, learning a procedure, learning to change one's behavior, etc.) require different types of instruction. In the second part of the course, we'll look in detail at models of how people learn from texts and what features (e.g., advanced organizers, examples, metaphors, illustrations, multimedia) enhance learning under what circumstances. We will study and analyze particular types of texts. Some possible examples include an introduction to the concept of gravity; a tutorial for computer software; a self-paced unit in French; adult educational materials in health care; a workshop on sexual harassment in the workplace; or a unit to train someone how to moderate a discussion. We will also look at various methods (concept mapping, think-aloud, comprehension tests, etc.) that are used to plan and evaluate instructional text.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />American Studies as a discipline is only about sixty years old -- born of Cold War anxiety and expansionism. Think, for a minute, about the fact that the novelist Tom Wolfe (Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and Bonfire of the Vanities) got his PhD in American Studies at Yale (the first US American Studies program) in 1958. Wolfe says that his grad school exposure to sociology helped him to write about the importance of status for early astronauts in The Right Stuff. American Studies is a first cousin to Cultural Studies, but it is not exactly the same thing. In this course we will read mostly secondary texts -- scholarly works -- that are on the cutting edge of the "new methods" in American Studies, and the course readings will range from the Revolutionary War era to the present. Texts will include Christina Klein, "Why American Studies Needs to Think About Korean Cinema," Jonathan Sterne, MP3, Brian Edwards, ed., Globalizing American Studies, Richard Purcell, Race, Ralph Ellison, and American Cold War Culture, Walden?s Shore: Henry David Thoreau and Nineteenth Century Science, Wonder of Wonders: A Cultural History of Fiddler on the Roof, The Networked Wilderness: Communicating in Early New England, Book of Ages: The Life and Opinion of Jane Franklin, Gaga Feminism: Sex, Gender and the End of Normal, Sense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global, and Transatlantic Traffic and (Mis)Translations.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This class is the first in a two-semester course on what has become, in academic period taxonomies, the long  (British) eighteenth century.  This period, as constituted in anthologies and course syllabi, extends back to 1660 and pushes well into what has traditionally been called the Romantic period in British literary studies.  The rich understanding that the literature and culture of this time period bring to historical narratives of modernity and how we experience them today has motivated scholars to carve out this capacious time frame, and recently, experts in the field have sought to expand its geographic as well as temporal scope by including cultural and textual trafficking between Britain and her North American colonies.    Our Fall class will begin with the return of Charles II to the British throne after the turmoil of the English Civil Wars and the Interregnum, and the reopening of the playhouses in 1660.   We will end Fall term in the late 1750s with the emergence of the novel as a popular genre in a rapidly expanding print market, and the political and cultural consolidation of a British imperialist presence in North America.  In between our beginning and end dates, we will sample multiple genres in print and performance texts as well as visual media and decorative arts produced in and about the British Isles and their North American colonies.

Example, Fall 2010: In the early decades of the twentieth century, Irish and British writers transformed literary representation, abandoning the certainty of Realism to delve into representations of the human subconscious resulting in fractured narratives in keeping with the uncertainty of that historically pivotal time. As conceptions of national identity were called into question with traumas associated with the First World War, Modernist writers attended to the tensions between wholeness and disintegration in the individual and in collective bodies. In Irish and British Modernism we will explore the tensions between illusions of a whole associated with political movements like nationalism and fascism and the disorienting though sometimes liberating forces of disintegration that surfaced in the essays, poetry, plays, novels and short stories of four Modernist writers: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, William Butler Yeats and T.S. Eliot. American Modernism will be offered in the spring, which will build off elements of this initial introduction to Irish and British Modernism.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course examines Romantic-age writing as responding to the volatile political and religious controversies that helped make the period 1789-1830 an important cultural pivot in the history of modernity.  As a seminar, the course will focus on three cases of the rapidly changing dialectic of orthodoxy and heterodoxy -- the French Revolution controversy that polarized British culture in the 1790s, the idealism/materialism debate  that emerged after 1800 to help redefine the contours of knowledge-production, and the role of new print and oral media within which a new and lastingly influential idea of "literature" would emerge.  In all three cases, we need to understand how deeply political and religious questions were entwined for these writers. We will also distinguish between "religions" (as formally institutionalized) and "religiosity" -- defining religiosity as more diffused or displaced feelings, ideas and practices that are often not clearly marked as religious or related to any one institutional religion, but can suffuse both literary and political ideas in far-reaching ways. To this end we focus especially on the work of William Blake and the perspective of "radical enthusiasm"; William Godwin, Anna Barbauld, and William Hazlitt as "rational Dissenters"; Wordsworth's and Coleridge's trajectory from Dissent in the 1790s to Anglican orthodoxy in the 1810s; Shelley's literary politics of atheism; and the role of British evangelicals (Hannah More, Thomas Bernard) in shaping Britain's "conservative revolution" at the turn of the nineteenth century.  Readings in cross-disciplinary scholarship and theory will include the sociology and rhetoric of religion (Weber, Bourdieu, Balfour), the intellectual history of British radicalism (Gilmartin, McCalman), and recent critical scholarship on politics of Romantic literary culture (Duncan, Chandler).<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

To begin answering these questions, we will take as case studies several new discursive digital media formations, such as digital books, on-line newspapers, blogs, wikis, and so forth, along with related social formations, such as social media and distributed non-profit activist organizations. The readings will provide a range of lens by which to understand these developments, including cognitive, social, political, economic and technological aspects. We will briefly put the development of communication technologies in their historical context: How were new forms of communication received in the past? How were they used? How did they affect communication? How did they influence political and social institutions? We will focus, however, on using knowledge of historical developments to inform our understandings of current digital communication developments.  Along the way we will ask questions, such as "What are some of the challenges that new digital formations present to traditional communication theories (e.g., What does authorship look like in massively open online collaborations when the boundaries between reading and authoring are blurred? How is trust established when speakers are anonymous and globally distributed? How are identities discursively constructed?

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This course is an introduction to the thinking, meaning-making process that underlies reading and writing. It asks: what are the social and cognitive processes, what are the conscious and unconscious problem-solving strategies we use: to comprehend and interpret text, to construct and communicate our own meanings, and to project or discover our readers' responses? In the first half of the course we look at writers and designers as thinkers and problem solvers-facing the challenge of equally creative, meaning-making readers and their own constructive, interpretive processes of comprehension. Understanding (and user-testing for) how readers actually interpret texts is critical to many kinds of writing, from informative websites and PR work, to persuasive applications and powerful arguments. An introduction to the research and theory on reading and writing as a social/cognitive process lets us explore the why behind the what readers do. For instance, you will learn how memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge can shape and are shaped by language and discourse as socially constructed mediating tools. At the same time you will develop a portfolio of methods that track the constructive, inferential process of readers' comprehension. In the second half of the course we turn to you and your own writing as a thinking process engaged in the constant effort to juggle competing goals. You will gain insight into your current problem-solving strategies and develop new ones for doing reader-based writing and design. The final project (which studies your own process on a current writing task) will expand your portfolio of methods into a toolkit of expert strategies for 1) both composing and communication and for 2) user testing and inquiry into the comprehension of real readers that uncovers how others actually interpret what you thought you said.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

We will read canonical theories of sexuality-such as Freud's Three Essays on Sexuality and Foucault's Introduction to the History of Sexuality-and canonical theories of gender-such as Rubin's "Traffic in Women" and Butler's Gender Trouble.  But we will be particularly attentive to those texts that try to understand connections and disconnections between the construction of the two in theory and in practice.  To that end, and to ground our theoretical investigations in social historical context, we will focus on two discursive sites: the feminist "sex wars" of the 1980s and more recent preoccupations of feminists with sexuality, such as work by and on sex-workers, and the theory and practice of "trans"-both gender and sexuality-from the early modern and contemporary periods.   Possible readings in the former area might include Pat Califia, Amber Hollibaugh,  or Alice Echols; our "trans" cases might include Henry Fielding's Female Husband, Foucault's Herculine Barbin, Sandy Stone's and Susan Stryker's theoretical work in this area or the biographical writing of "gender warriors" such as Leslie Feinberg.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics will vary by semester. Spring 2013: Ever since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the technological exhibition in the nineteenth century, there has been a growing presence for science and technology in the lives of everyday citizens. In some cases, these phenomena have sparked the public's imagination and their promise has stirred their confidence in a better future. In other cases, they have kindled fears and generated protests over the risks of new technologies and the threats of novel scientific ideas to prevailing social, cultural, economic, and political orders. This course examines the complex dynamics in the relationships between science, technology, and society. Towards this end it engages with questions such as: How do we decide who an expert is? To what extent do scientists have an obligation to consider the social and ethical consequences of their work? Is public education about science and technology sufficient for addressing social concerns about risk and controversial scientific ideas? We will grapple with these and other questions by exploring modern public debates in which science, technology, and society play a primary role such as the AIDS crisis, global warming, and the autism vaccine debate. With the help of analytical theories from sociology, rhetoric, and public policy, we will develop a general framework for thinking about argument and the dynamics of the relationship between science, technology and the public. In addition, we will look to these fields for tools to assess specific instances of public debate and to complicate and/or affirm the prevailing theories about their relationship.

Some of the relevant research questions include: Why do visual variations exist across different contexts? (e.g., Popular science looks different from Discover.) Why and how do visual styles change over time? (e.g., Magazines from the 1950s don't look like present day magazines.) Do visual elements have persuasive power? If so, what roles do they play in shaping an argument? How do people learn to communicate using visual-verbal artifacts?   \tIn this seminar, we will address these and other questions through readings and discussions on various threads of studies around the analysis of communicative artifacts that integrate visual and verbal expressions. We will review key research publications concerning visual-verbal communication from relevant disciplines, including professional & technical communication, rhetoric, argumentation, and literacy. Particular attention will be paid to descriptive methods (e.g., social-semiotic analysis, visual argument, and rhetorical structure theory) and the types of questions these methods can help us answer. Throughout the semester, students will be encouraged to explore the visual-verbal communication artifacts found around them and use those to connect class discussions to the practice of design.

The Monty Python group assumed that their satire Monty Python and the Holy Grail would be understood in some detail in order for its humor to be appreciated; the nineteenth century poets and novelists had made the same assumption. It is no exaggeration to say that our own structures of feeling concerning love, sex, and adventure still reflect this influence. This course will juxtapose some of the medieval tales that found the genre with their more recent counterparts, for example Chretien's Lancelot with Malory's retelling of that story in Morte D'Arthur, Tennyson's retelling of Malory, and T. H. White's Once and Future King (the basis of the musical and film Camelot). Recent novels such as Scott Spencer's Endless Love, A.S. Byatt's Possession, and Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose are also set beside their medieval antecedents.

Consult the course descriptions provided by the department for current offerings Example, Fall 2010: Before the Beat Generation there was the Lost Generation. Both moments of literary history have an important relevance for our time, and both produced many major literary works. The 20's, like the 50's and 60's were marked by the effects of World War. Gertrude Stein seems to have started the whole generation-naming fad with her comment to Hemingway, "You are all a lost generation." Paul Fussell identifies the cultural effect of WWI as the production of "irony" as the central quality of modern identity. Of course, the "lost" generation wasn't really lost even if it was searching for new ways of understanding experience. And "beat" generation wasn't beaten down either. And irony wasn't invented yesterday even if it still is a dominant mode of modern experience. The last generation to have a really significant name, the beat generation was marked in part by an interest in jazz, and an intense interest in the power of writing. Writing was both a form of recording a response (often oppositional, often ecstatic) to what was going on in the world, and it was also a way of re-inventing the world by discovering some kind of previously hidden secret that only "writing" could uncover. There is a continuing interest in beat writing these days, days which are usually taken to be characterized by a decline in print literacy accompanied by a growth in force of electronic media. So, amongst other things, reading the Beats offers us an opportunity to explore our own times, as well as to read (or-read) a body of powerful visionary literature from the recent past.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics will vary by semester. Fall 2014: Today television is ?old media.? But what was television like when it was ?new media?? In this course we will think about how television transformed American culture. We will look at individual genres, like drama, sitcoms, westerns, variety shows and game shows. We will watch I Love Lucy, I Remember Mama, The Goldbergs, The Milton Berle Show, Amos n Andy, Queen for a Day, The Phil Silvers Show, the western Cheyenne, The Honeymooners, Leave it to Beaver and teleplays like Marty and A Man is Ten Feet Tall, We will think about the social and political history of television, including television and the Cold War, television and Civil Rights, and television and electoral politics. Ultimately, the framing question of this class will be a media studies question:  how do media technologies change our lives, and how do they NOT change our lives? How is the television revolution similar to our current digital revolution? What can we learn about new media by studying old media?.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-439 Advanced Seminar in Film and Media Studies: Hollywood Film Genres</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />During Hollywood's "Classic Era," roughly 1920-1960, film production was focused on a relatively few genres, which served both aesthetic and marketing functions. Though for a time beginning in 1960s, many critics looked down on genre films, preferring such seeming outliers as Citizen Kane, it is now widely recognized that genre films are what defined the era's classicism.  This course will look at the genres of that era through the lens of Howard Hawks, who has been called "the master of all genres." Since the 1950s when French critics such as Francois Truffaut began to make the case, Hawks has been generally accepted as one of greatest directors of all time, yet he is much less well known to day than his contemporaries John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock, perhaps because each of them was closely identified with a single genre.  Hawks is probably best remembered for romantic comedies such as His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby, and for a pair of films he made in the 1940s with Humphrey Bogart, To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep. But, he also made war pictures (Dawn Patrol), action-adventure stories (Only Angels Have Wings), musicals (Gentlemen Prefer Blonds), Westerns (Red River), one of the great gangster films, the original Scarface, and even Biblical epic. He is often credited as the auteur of sci-fi movie he produced. Hawks was known as for making movies that commented on others in the same genre, as his Western Rio Bravo does of Fred Zinnemann's High Noon. We will use Hawks's film to understand Hollywood genres in formal, cultural, and economic terms. Most weeks we will watch one film by Hawks and one film in the same genre by another director. Each student will contribute to the seminar in the form of oral reports and a research paper.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-440 Postcolonial Theory: Diaspora and Transnationalism</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Arjun Appadurai argues that one of the primary transformations in this period of globalization has been in the capacity for people to imagine themselves or their children will live and work in places other than where they were born.  Although the novel has long been considered a national form, contemporary novels frequently represent transnational mobility, both in their plots and as global commodities.  A significant body of contemporary fiction focuses on imaginative and physical movement across national borders.  This global literature course combines literary and theoretical readings to examine the experiences of transnationalism and diaspora.  Theories of transnationalism look at the interconnections that cut across nations.  The concept of diaspora, a term first used to reference the movement of a people out of a homeland, has become a way to think about the identities of immigrants, migrant workers, and refugees.  Readings for the course will be drawn from a diverse group of writers from around the globe.  Literary readings might include works by Caryl Phillips, Jamaica Kincaid, Christina Garcia, Nadeem Aslam and Jhumpa Lahiri; theoretical readings might include works by Salman Rushdie, Paul Gilroy, Gloria Anzaldúa, Arjun Appadurai, Inderpal Grewal and Avtar Brah.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-443 Shakespeare and Theory</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Shakespeare's plays have been produced and read under all sorts of conditions for more than 400 years. It seems that each generation has a different take on their meanings and implications. Early criticism weighed their "beauties" and "flaws," and more recently their place in intellectual and social life has been analyzed by deconstructive, historical, psychoanalytic, marxist, and feminist commentary. In the seminar, we will read six plays (one comedy, one history, one "problem play," one romance, and two tragedies) each accompanied by an essay proposing a particular theoretical position and some related criticism.  Students will be honing their skills as readers of some of the most complex and challenging texts in the English language and simultaneously learning to write criticism of their own. This seminar is not an introduction to Shakespeare; it is designed for students who have thought seriously about some of the plays (studied at the college level, acted in or directed productions, or the like) and wish to broaden and deepen their understanding. It is not limited to English and Drama majors. Regular attendance and participation (including occasional in-class writing) are required.  Everyone will present a "position statement" to the seminar and submit two prepared papers.  Grads and undergrads will work together every week for three hours; grad students will meet for an extra hour each week to discuss additional readings and prepare conference-ready seminar papers.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-444 Studies in Print Culture: History of Books and Reading: Media before &quot;New Media&quot;</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Rather than putting an end to the book (as McLuhan had forecast) digital media have had the oddly exhilarating effect of making us look at all kinds of print,, past and present, through newly focused lenses.  This course will introduce you to the history of books and reading, a cross-fertilizing field of study that is having an impact on many disciplines, from the history of science to literary history, cultural studies, and the arts.  We will read scholarship in this still-emerging field to orient you to its key issues, practical and methodological problems, and theoretical implications: work by Roger Chartier, Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Eisenstein, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel de Certeau, Adrian Johns, and others. We?ll also read primary texts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries?including Joseph Addison, Jane Austen, Samuel Coleridge, Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins--to see how differing modes of print and reading were keenly contested cultural and political matters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Other topics include the division between new reading publics and their ways of reading books; important changes in book production, typography, printing methods (hand-press to steam press). We will study the relation between the aesthetic powers of the ?text? and the material pleasures of the ?book?; the emergence of a modern, imaginative category of ?literature? in conjunction with the consolidating power of the novel. Such knowledge of the history of print has become especially crucial in an era of emerging ?new media? and the field of digital humanities in the university.        Two papers will be required?one shorter paper (5-7 pp.) and a longer research paper on  the uses of books and print by producers and readers. Though the course meets in Baker Hall, you will have hands-on experience with early books and other forms of print as we also meet periodically in the Rare Book Room at Hunt Library.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Fall 2012: Allegory has both a broad meaning involving any attachment of ideas to literary structure and a narrow meaning in which simple morality tales feature characters like Fellowship and Good Deeds. We will make use of both broad and narrow definitions. The long reign of "realistic" fiction was levered against allegory, which was was often dismissed of as simpleminded, unattractively didactic, and "medieval." More recently, sometimes in connection with our current interest in "alternative universes," the term and the concept have taken on a new importance in political discourse and in the interpretation of science fiction. The course will consider some medieval, some twentieth century, and some very recent allegories (mostly on film or video), in an attempt to explore theories of both allegorical and realistic narrative modes.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-448 The Global Renaissance</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />We are living in a "global" age. So, at least, we are often told. But it was in 1571, after all, that silver extracted in South America was first traded in China, for porcelain. So when did we become "global?" What were we before we were "global?" Or has humanity always already been "global?" In any case, why do so many people insist on speaking of "globalization," as though "global" was a destination we haven't yet reached? This course anchors such questions in the literature, history, and culture of the English Renaissance, a period regularly invoked as "foreshadowing" or "inaugurating" current-day globalization. With attention to major figures like Shakespeare and Donne, but also to lesser known merchants, travelers, cartographers, imperialists, linguists, and lawyers, we will investigate the argument that the roots of our present "global" age can be identified in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In order to develop more sophisticated thinking about history's relation to our own putatively unique, "global" age, students will read primary works alongside a healthy helping of historical scholarship and theory. Assignments will include a review presentation, an annotated bibliography, and an article-length final research paper.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

Example, Spring 2010: College seems a space apart, before you enter the real world. Accordingly, we don't think of fiction and film that depicts life in college as all that serious. However, there is a growing tradition of fiction of university life, whether of students or professors. In particular, a great many prominent contemporary writers have written novels set on campuses, and a number of major film directors have turned their lights on university life. In this course, we will survey the realm of college fiction and film, from F. Scott Fitzgerald to Michael Chabon. We will try to put together its history, distinguish its major types, and diagnose its contemporary representations. We will also look at relevant historical, theoretical, and sociological works that bear on the university.

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-450 History of Critical Ideas: Problems of Reading, Interpretation &amp; Spectatorship</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Topics vary by semester. Consult the English Department for the most current description. Example, Fall 2011: "I'm not a lawyer, but\205" How many times have you heard this disclaimer, closely followed by a lay analysis of law? This course, an introduction to the cultural study of law for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, can be seen as an introduction to what goes into the making of such a statement. Where do we get our ideas about law? What do we mean when we say "law"? What counts as law? How does culture influence law, and law, culture? And to what degree must history condition any answers we might be tempted to give? Students in the course will study works in a range of genres (novels, plays, poems, judicial opinions, pamphlets) and develop methods for investigating ways that law and culture have been made by one another from the 16th-century to the present. Readings will include influential theoretical accounts of law (Aristotle, Hobbes, Kant, E.P. Thompson, Habermas, Hart, Derrida, MacKinnon) and canonical texts in "Law and Literature," such as Shakespeare's Measure for Measure.   As a counterpoint to the fiercely ahistorical "law and economics" movement, however, the course will put special emphasis on rooting intersections of law and culture in rich historical context, considering both local and international legal contexts (sometimes in highly technical detail) alongside so-called "ephemera" of culture. Students will tackle the especially fruitful "case" of Renaissance Britain before developing their own final research projects, whether on the Renaissance or another period of their choosing.

<dt class="keepwithnext">76-452 Patterns of English Usage</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Patterns of English Usage is for both graduate and undergraduate students a research course. This means that for all students there is an emphasis on carrying out investigations at first hand and reporting your results. The course is intended to provide experience in recovering data on patterns of English usage from a corpus. It is an introduction to "corpus linguistics," a set of techniques for studying the distribution of words and phrases as they are actually used in discourse (as opposed to how we might think or imagine they are used without reference to texts). Corpus linguistics is a new field. It incorporates methods and concepts that have only become possible since the advent of large-scale data storage and high-speed search software. It challenges normative grammar by asking whether we are entitled to say that words and phrases have dictionary meanings that are distinct from their uses in discourse. It takes grammar away from authorities and places it in the mouths and pens of users of the language. We will be using the Cobuild (Collins/Birmingham University International Linguistic Database) corpus. By the end of the semester you will have learned the conventions for entering a well-formed Cobuild query, including various wildcard and category-dependent searches, and some elementary corpus concepts such as "collocation" and "transitional probability." You will also have learned about some aspects of conventional approaches to English grammar (structural grammar, generative grammar) with which to compare and contrast the corpus approach.<br />

Authors such as Kenyan Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Indian Arundhati Roy provide vibrant portrayals of individual and community life in formerly colonized countries; postcolonial theorists, meanwhile, offer ways to situate these literary works in their diverse historical and cultural contexts. In this course we will interweave a study of literature with that of theory and history as we focus on works by African, Indian, Caribbean and Irish writers and critics.  Readings might include fiction, drama, poetry and film by such authors as Ama Ata Aidoo, J.M. Coetzee, Jamaica Kincaid, Zoë Wicomb, Brian Friel, and Aravind Adiga.

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />In this unsettled age, when large portions of the earth's surface are being ravaged by industrialism, when on several continents indigenous peoples are being forcibly uprooted\205, when philosophers and poets (and even the odd sociologist or two) are asserting that attachments to geographical localities contribute fundamentally to the formation of personal and social identities, when new forms of 'environmental awareness' are being more radically charted and urgently advocated than ever in the past\205it is unfortunate that [we] seldom study what people make of places.   (Keith H. Basso, "Wisdom Sits in Places")    It is sometimes claimed that place is no longer important in human life, now that we spend more and more time in virtual spaces and participate more and more in global economic and social networks. In this course we will test this claim, first by reading and discussing theories of place and space from critical theory and cultural geography, and then by reading about and carrying out case studies exploring intersections between discourse (talk and writing) and place. Our methods will include bibliographic and archival research, discourse analysis, and ethnographic techniques. Students' projects will draw on your professional and scholarly interests and expertise, and the places and discourse practices you study can range from the local (a workplace, for example) to the global (the internet, for example).

As a published author, foreign correspondent and Pulitzer-Prize winning editor, the instructor has been a foot soldier in print journalism and media management for 30 years. The practical emphasis of the course reflects his extensive and varied background. The course focuses on the four stages necessary to any nonfiction story: idea, concept, reporting and writing. Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalism's glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy. The last segment of the course examines the evolution of journalism in the digital age and the impact that is having on the media landscape, particularly print.

Since then, the field has become a vibrant new area of research in the discipline of rhetoric. Rhetoricians of science study various aspects of science including the importance of language and argument to the development of scientific knowledge, the use of rhetorical argument in science, and the process of communication within and scientific disciplines as well as between scientists and the public.     \tIn this course, we take the broad view of the rhetoric of science. We will examine many facets of scientific communication including scientific audiences, visuals, and conventions for argument. By exploring these elements of science we will begin to develop the sophisticated understanding of scientific communication and argumentation necessary for undertaking complex rhetorical analyses. Specifically, we will be driven by questions such as:      \tHow do scientists argue their case with one another?    \tHow is scientific information and argument transformed when it is accommodated for popular arguments?    \tHow does the social and historical context in which science is done shape the way that science is communicated and/or argued?   \tIn what ways do the language and style shape scientific knowledge and communication?    \tWhat argumentative solutions can visuals supply in science and what argumentative problems<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Effective marketing and communications are essential to the success of businesses, non-profit agencies, academic institutions, public interest groups, and other entities that have a shared purpose and identity to promote. This course explores marketing and communications in organizational settings, where professional communicators manage relationships with a wide variety of constituencies: customers, investors, news agencies, employees, members, volunteers, local communities or government agencies. To succeed, communicators must be able to identify and articulate the communication needs of the organizations they represent, develop well-informed strategies for advancing organizational objectives, think and act quickly in high-pressure situations, and write clear and persuasive prose. In this course, you will develop the written and oral communication skills needed by a professional communicator in an organization. You will learn to identify and define a coherent, integrated strategy for all of an organization's communications and to devise and apply effective marketing and public relations tactics in traditional and social media for achieving business objectives. You will gain practice in writing op-ed essays, press releases, critiques of organizational communications, and marketing and communication plans.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=76-270" title="76-270" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-270');">76-270</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-271" title="76-271" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-271');">76-271</a></dd>

This class will provide students with the opportunity to develop the ability to analyze and create multimedia experiences. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary of multimedia, as well as the practical issues surrounding multimedia design through a series of hands-on projects involving various contexts. We will explore what it means to write for a dynamic medium and how the elements of time, motion and interactivity can help writers expand their communicative skills. Class discussion and critiques are an essential part of this course.  While students are not expected to become masters of multimedia software, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Flash, audio and additional creative tools will be taught in the class in order to provide them with the basic skills necessary to complete assignments and explore multimedia possibilities.<br />Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=76-270" title="76-270" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-270');">76-270</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-271" title="76-271" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-271');">76-271</a>) and (<a href="/search/?P=51-261" title="51-261" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '51-261');">51-261</a> or <a href="/search/?P=51-262" title="51-262" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '51-262');">51-262</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-391" title="76-391" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-391');">76-391</a>).<br />

It attempts (1) to address the theoretical and methodological issues in cross-/inter-cultural communication from a rhetorical point of view and (2) to examine critically the way comparative studies of different rhetorical traditions/systems are currently conducted.  In particular, it is concerned with the rhetorical problems we encounter in trying to write, argue, and persuade across languages and cultures. And it aims to take a close look at the need for rhetoric to rethink its own identity, purpose, formation and agenda in an increasingly multicultural and globalized world.<br />

The focus will be on verbal rhetoric, but students who wish to analyze visual rhetoric interactively with verbal rhetoric will be welcome to do so. In the first part of the course, we will review various methods for analyzing digital texts descriptively (viz., concordance, collocate and keyword analysis) and inferentially, through multivariate analysis (e.g., manova, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis). To learn these methods, in the first half of the course, we will use simple textual data sets supplied by the instructor. In the second half of the class, students will choose their own digital environments to analyze and they will be expected to write publishable-quality rhetorical analyses of these environments. To meet this expectation, students will need to do considerable background research in the digital environments they are studying.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />"The difficult part in an argument is not to defend one?s opinion, but rather to know it." -André Maurois  This seminar will be an in-depth exploration of theories of argument and assumes some prior knowledge or coursework in argumentation such as acquired in <a href="/search/?P=76-373" title="76-373" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-373');">76-373</a>-773. As the above quote from Maurois suggests, we will take a broad view of the concept of ?argument? and examine its role as a discursive means of truth seeking, knowledge creation, and decision-making, not just as the practice of using language to justify or refute a conclusion. The goal of the seminar is for participants to acquire the concepts needed to read the current research/scholarship on argumentation with understanding, to apply that research to the analysis of arguments, and to be positioned to contribute to that research. We will begin with a brief history of the classical Greek writings on logic, rhetoric and dialectic, especially the writings of Aristotle. There are questions from that tradition that endure to this day:  What does it take for a conclusion to be well supported? What criteria should govern acceptance of a conclusion? We will also examine two landmarks in the contemporary study of argumentation, Perelman and Olbrects-Tyteca?s The New Rhetoric and Toulmin?s The Uses of Arguments, both published in 1958.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-101" title="76-101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-101');">76-101</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html</a></dd>

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />As the Internet has increasingly become an integral part of professional and technical communication in all organizations, writers entering the workplace are expected to have a broad range of web design skills to complement their expertise in writing and design for print. Thus, we've designed this course to help writers learn the broad range of skills needed to develop communication materials that are tailored for the web. In particular, the course focuses on the planning, design, and testing of the visual and verbal content typical of contemporary websites. As a member of the class, you'll participate in a guided, semester-long web design project, which is scaffolded with a series of group and individual assignments. The project begins with an introduction to user-centered methods for understanding the audience (users), where you will learn and practice foundational user-centered design methods through readings and a series of hands on exercises, including interviews, and observation of actual users. You will also learn theories and methods for developing effective information architecture, including organizational schemes, navigational design, labeling, form design, and visual design. Working in groups with other students, you will, over the course of the semester, develop a prototype of a small website, which will be evaluated through user testing at the end of the semester. While we focus primarily on the activities described above, we'll also discuss sound and animation, emerging technologies such as Web 2.0 and Mobile Web, and social media.<br />Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=76-270" title="76-270" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-270');">76-270</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-271" title="76-271" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-271');">76-271</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-272" title="76-272" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-272');">76-272</a>) and (<a href="/search/?P=51-261" title="51-261" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '51-261');">51-261</a> or <a href="/search/?P=51-262" title="51-262" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '51-262');">51-262</a> or 76-382 or <a href="/search/?P=76-391" title="76-391" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-391');">76-391</a>)<br />Corequisite: <a href="/search/?P=76-488" title="76-488" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-488');">76-488</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />In traditional public policy approaches, each step of the policy process from defining a problem to making a case for its solution is assessed in reference to rational models of economic and political actors. This course, however, takes a less conventional rhetorical approach to public policy which focuses attention on the values, beliefs, and argument structures associated with issues as a means of assessing them and as a method for moving forward with effective arguments towards their resolution. Towards this end, we will be studying the theories and analytic methods of both classical and modern rhetoric as well as modern public policy theory. Over the course of the semester, we will combine knowledge and techniques from both fields to examine the development of the public policy debate over the safety and efficacy of nuclear power as a solution to the current environmental and energy security challenges faced by the United States. No previous experience with public policy or knowledge about nuclear power is necessary for this course.

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />Healthcare Communications is a writing-intensive course designed for students interested in how healthcare information is developed by researchers, healthcare providers and writers and communicated to patients and their families, the general public, and other experts. Throughout the course, we will explore where people find medical information, how they use and evaluate it, and what challenges writers face in supporting informed healthcare decisions while communicating ideas that can be complex, provocative and sometimes frightening. We will read and discuss published literature dealing with issues in health literacy, clinical research, and patient care. We will also learn the basics of reading, understanding, and interpreting the research literature and communicating research findings to non-experts. Early in the semester, you'll choose a medical area of interest that you will research using sources such as journals, articles, books and web sites, as well as direct contact with appropriate medical, healthcare, and/or research professionals. For your final project, you will write and design materials that will meet a specific need or gap you identify in existing information. The final project could be a magazine article, a website, patient education material such as brochures or training materials, or another vehicle that emphasizes accurate, informative and engaging writing. In addition, there will be several short writing assignments to build the research and writing skills needed to effectively communicate healthcare information. A background in health, medicine or science is not necessary for this course, but a willingness to learn about these areas is essential.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=76-270" title="76-270" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-270');">76-270</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-271" title="76-271" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-271');">76-271</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-272" title="76-272" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-272');">76-272</a> or <a href="/search/?P=76-395" title="76-395" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '76-395');">76-395</a></dd>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br />Narratives are most frequently thought of as a literary genre but in reality they are a much more diverse and highly rhetorical genre. Narratives are also a powerful way of influencing the interpretation of events and situations, and the promotion of certain goals and agendas. They are in fact a form of strategic discourse. We see this, for example, in the increasing use of narrative in journalism, in the presentation of controversial historical events, in current political debates about immigration reform, and in workplace communication. In these contexts, narratives function as a source of authority and legitimation. To understand this function, we will discuss several key concepts in narrative theory, and then apply them to several case studies. We will look at how immigrant narratives circulating in the United States create stock images of immigrants as a threat; at how politicians use autobiographical narration to claim authority; and at how workplace narratives establish roles, boundaries, and power relations.  The requirements for this course include one mid-semester take home exam (made of short essay questions and the analysis of a given text) and a final research paper.<br />

<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br />Human activity transcends political, geographical, and cultural boundaries. From wars to social movements, immigration to environmental change, our world has long been globalized. Acquiring the ability to understand such transnational and even global processes is an indispensable part of any college education. This course provides students with an opportunity to develop the skills and perspectives needed to understand the contemporary world through investigating its global history. A variety of sections are offered in order to give students the opportunity to choose between different themes and approaches. All sections are comparable in their composition of lectures and recitations, required amounts of reading, and emphasis on written assignments as the central medium of assessment. The sections all aim to help students: (1) master knowledge through interaction with the instructors, reading material, and other students, (2) think critically about the context and purpose of any given information, (3) craft effective verbal and written arguments by combining evidence, logic, and creativity, and (4) appreciate the relevance of the past in the present and future.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course studies problems of food supplies, food shortages, and famine in the context of social, economic, family, and population systems. We use studies by historians, sociologists, demographers and economists to explore the topic.  We use the historical record to show how population systems in East and West functioned to keep resources and needs in balance, and how they often failed.      We explore theoretical models that shed light on how and why famines occur, including Malthus's theory of population and, more recently, Amartya Sen's theory of food entitlements.    We examine several case studies of famine closely, including the Irish famine of the mid-nineteenth century and the Bengal famine of 1943-44 to understand their causes and consequences.    In order to understand how different societies addressed food shortages and famine, we also look at the work of government agencies, charitable institutions, and NGOs [non-governmental agencies] in  mitigating famine's effects.    The course uses scholarly studies as well as primary sources such as eyewitness accounts, journalists' accounts and government reports to evoke the human experience of famine.      Coursework includes assigned readings and discussion, oral reports, and responses to reading assignments. Students will also have the opportunity to carry out individual research projects.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Living in a society still struggling to come to grips with its own history of slavery, American scholars have often imposed words like "slavery" and "freedom" onto African contexts.  But, such labels have the effect of masking dynamic social institutions in pre-colonial Africa.    This course will turn this terminology on its head by delineating the relationship between  "slavery" and "freedom," kinship, dependency, and marginality.  It will look historically at institutions which are integral to African societies, such as patron-client relationships, marriage, and pawnship.  It will interrogate the multiple ways that these institutions functioned before the period of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the multiple ways that African communities transformed their institutions in response to it.  Students will engage a variety of historigraphical debates in secondary sources and first-hand testimonies of "slave's" primary sources.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course examines European history from the Black Death to the French Revolution, a period known to history as the "early modern" period. That is, it marks a period in European history that was not quite medieval, and yet not quite modern. Many features of modern society, such as the nation-state, free-trade economies, religious pluralism, scientific rationalism, and secular culture trace their origins to the early modern era, yet the period was also marked by important continuities with the Middle Ages. During this course, we will explore how Europeans re-imagined their world in its transition from the medieval to the modern. Topics to be considered will include the "renaissance" of the arts, the problems of religious reform, exploration and colonialism, the rise of science, and the expansion of the state. Through these developments, we will focus on Europeans' changing notions of the human body, the body politic, and the natural world, as well as their re-interpretations of the proper relation between the human and the divine, the individual and the community, and the present and the past.<br />

By analyzing the sweeping political changes in the region that had occurred in a relatively short historical time, students will better understand the emergence of nationalist movements and radical political ideologies such as socialism and fascism during the interwar period against a backdrop of regional histories of centuries-long inter-ethnic cohabitation. They will also assess to what extent these earlier histories continued to subtly influence the social landscapes of post-1945 Central and Eastern Europe, thus complicating the processes of socialist modernization that the new regimes tried to implement in the region under the close scrutiny of the USSR. Course materials will include not only historical and anthropological readings, but also historical documents, literary texts and films from the region.

However, we will not review the many recipes political scientists and economists offer. Instead we will explore the policy choices the European Union can make and the constraints it faces in efforts to balance the need for a more effective, closer union, the diverse interests of its member states, and the political demands of the European citizens. This requires a deeper understanding of the history of the EU, the reasons why and when European nation states decided to "pool sovereignty," and some understanding of the institutional structures that the EU has developed over time. In a final section we will revisit the current debate about the future of the EU and discuss the possible outcomes.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />"Europe's Two Revolutions" is a comparative history of Europe in the nineteenth century, focusing on France, Britain and Germany. The "Two Revolutions" title acknowledges that much of the history of Europe in this period can be understood as the legacies of the French Revolution of 1789-94, which unleashed new ideas about the nature of political life, and the Industrial Revolution, which brought a host of new social and economic problems to the continent. We approach the topic using a variety of sources including personal memoirs and eyewitness accounts, government reports, fictional accounts, speeches, and political writings of the time as well as more recent studies. We discuss the development of such important political and social movements as nationalism, feminism, conservatism and socialism, seeking to capture both similarities and differences in the ways these movements developed in the three countries. In addition to illuminating large trends in the nineteenth century, the course provides background for the study of twentieth-century European history, and for the history of other regions of the world that have been affected both by the revolutionary traditions born in France and processes of industrialization.<br />

It is, in part, a history of a civilization seen from its margins. We question the usual narrative of Chinas uncomplicated absorption of its neighbors and conquerors, and pay attention, unconventionally, to voices of minority peoples. Besides ecology, war and diplomacy, we examine cultural conceptions and mutual influences. We also look for the emergence of a sense of identity among peoples in contact, including Han Chinese, especially at the onset of nationalism and industrialization.

Latin America is marked by major bio-cultural diversity; a long history of economic "globalization;" and revolutionary political transformations.  In recent years, most Latin American nations have seen economic "growth" and convene peaceful elections, but enormous inequalities persist and environmental problems loom large. We will try to make sense of this reality via historical analysis. In so doing, we will consider long-standing debates over forms of government, economic models, the rights of citizens, the role of government in social welfare, and environmental sustainability.

However, when the Mexican Revolution began in 1910, Spanish and Portuguese colonialism had collapsed along with slavery, and the power of the church had greatly diminished. New societal institutions emerged that reflected novel ideas about the role of secular nation-states, "free market" economies, and the meanings of "civilization." This course will use scholarly writings, fiction, film, and video to analyze the profound changes that took place in Latin American society during and between these two important revolutions.

Students will move beyond the textbooks to explore primary source documents, maps, photographs, biographies and historical testimony. For five weeks in the middle of the semester, students will immerse themselves in an extended role-playing exercise, "The Struggle for Palestine, 1936," an elaborate simulation game linked to Barnard College's "Reacting to the Past" program. Students portraying British examiners, specific Arab and Zionist characters and various journalists will recreate the activities of the 1936 Royal Commission which came to Palestine to investigate the causes of an Arab rebellion and Arab-Jewish strife. This historical reenactment experience constitutes an exciting pedagogical opportunity for delving deeper into the topic material than regular coursework allows. All the role-playing will take place during regular class time, but students should be aware that they will need to devote considerable outside time for preparation and research. Outstanding attendance is also a requirement. Regular classroom activity resumes at the end of the five weeks.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course is a survey. It examines U.S. history through the eyes of women and gender. It begins in the colonial era (1600s) and runs chronologically to the present. It covers topics such as witchcraft, the story of Pocahontas, women's work, motherhood, slavery, and much more. We will look at the lives of individual women, as well as trends among women, paying attention to questions of race and class. At the same time, we will explore changing concepts of gender, meaning ideas about what women are or should be. Finally, the course asks: how different does American history look when we factor in women and gender?.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This small discussion course traces ideas about individualism and capitalism in the U.S., from colonial times to the present. We will focus on three main themes: 1) the relationship between capitalism, work, and identity; 2) changing definitions of success and failure; and 3) the historical origins of contemporary attitudes toward 1 & 2. In short, we will study the economics and emotions of the American dream: how class, race,  gender, occupation, and ambition shape our identities. Readings include "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin," studies by Alexis de Tocqueville and Max Weber, writings of Frederick Douglass, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville, and Henry Thoreau, Kate Chopin's "The Awakening," Andrew Carnegie's "Gospel of Wealth," Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," and other works. Grading is based upon a readings journal, participation in discussion, three short essays and a longer final paper.

The United States also made great strides in expanding political and civil rights for workers, women, African-Americans, and gays and lesbians. This course explores the cultural implications of these developments on the generations of American people who came of age in the twentieth century. It assesses both the triumphs and tribulations of twentieth-century life. We will analyze the continuities, contradictions, and conflicts in American history, especially in regard to the nation's dueling political ideologies: conservatism and liberalism. Special attention will be given to the evolving relationship among the state, the corporate sector, and ordinary people.

We first look at the multiple impacts of the Revolution on French society.  We try to understand some of the lasting features of nineteenth and early-twentieth century France by studying the lives of different social groups including workers, peasants, and members of the elites. We follow the continuing problem of French political instability in the nineteenth century, trying to understand the deep rifts that divided different groups of French people from one another.  We look at the devastating impacts of World War One and the Great Depression, and end with the collapse of France in 1940.

Understanding life under the German Occupation and the collaborationist government in Vichy also requires us to look back at major political, social and economic conditions of the 1930s that divided the French people.      We use film and personal memoirs as well as recent historical studies to recreate a sense of life during the war, and try to answer such questions as:  What accounts for the French military collapse of 1940?  Which groups of French men and women benefitted from collaboration with Germany? How did France's collaboration in the Holocaust come about?  We also consider how the French people have tried to come to terms with their wartime experience since the 1940s.  This course is open to all students.

If we examine the Chinese quarter of humanity in this way, we can better understand the interplay of ecology and history, of class and community, and of self and society in China-and in any other society. We may also gain a new perspective on the West, whose peculiarities we too readily take as normal. This introductory course focuses on Chinese solutions to Chinese problems, as reflected in the words of the literate (e.g., philosophers and soldiers, dramatists and novelists) or in the actions of the unlettered (e.g., peasants, women and religious cultists). We proceed by making explicit their values and ours, setting up a kind of discourse across cultures. Special attention is paid to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />"Globalization" is a familiar term that is often used to invoke the idea that places around the world are rapidly becoming more interconnected. This is so, but it is also true that this is far being from a simple or harmonious process. Rather, "globalization" involves a wide range of uneven and disputed cultural, political, economic, and social developments that often influence one another but vary markedly in their significance, impact, and intensity. Economic crisis, impoverishment, rising inequality, environmental degradation, pandemic disease, and militant ethnic, religious, and nationalist movements are just as much a part of the contemporary global landscape as are technological innovation, instantaneous communication, shifts in the global division of labor, the creation of new wealth and knowledge, the promotion and defense of human rights, and the rise of cosmopolitan values and perspectives. This course introduces you to important ways of thinking about globalization and will acquaint you with the kinds of research, evidence, and information upon which these kinds of thinking rely.

From intense moments of popular uprising, like the 1999 Seattle protests against the WTO meetings or the water wars in Bolivia, to the continuous and extended efforts of organized social movements like the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the unified efforts of individuals working together carry limitless possibilities for drawing public attention and affecting the world in which we live. In this course, we will look at instances of social protest, investigating the forms it takes and the ways in which specific cultural and local histories are reflected and utilized in these spontaneous and organized expressions of collective will. Through readings and film we will pay attention to issues of organization and spontaneity, violence, and the use and definition of public spaces. Using case studies from across the world, with a particular focus on Latin America but also including Northern Ireland, Algeria, India, the United States, and Japan, we will consider how cultural forms can be taken and worked into powerful and sometimes dangerous techniques of resistance. We will examine as well the challenges that groups face when they reach beyond their local cultural histories to make national and transnational connections with other groups.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Anthropology is poised at the intersection of art and science. Like scientists, anthropologists collect and analyze data, but it is data gained through relationships forged with and by human beings situated in complex historical, social, political, and economic contexts. In this course, we will investigate the particular approach anthropologists take to research, focusing on the methods that anthropologists use, and the various ethical and technical dilemmas that they face.  Though focused on anthropology, the subject matter of this course is relevant for thinking through the moral and practical implications of research more generally.  We explore some key controversies that have arisen around anthropological research, and students are encouraged to think deeply and analytically about the particular kinds of knowledge that research generates and to reflect critically on anthropology's strengths and limitations. Note: This is a discussion-based course, where your success is contingent upon thoughtful and active participation.<br />

From child soldiers to sex workers, from adoptees to laborers, children form part of a global circulation that has complex personal, practical, and political consequences.  We will take an anthropological and a historical perspective, comparing the various ways in which children circulate, the changes over time, and the impact of both cultural values and human rights policies on these movements. We will analyze the role of nation-states, international organizations, and NGO's, along with the decisions individuals make about the well being of a child.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course will describe and analyze aspects of the development of public policy in the United States from the colonial era to the present, with a focus on the post-Civil War era.  For the purposes of this course, public policy will be defined as the making of rules and laws and their implementation by government: 1) in response to the failure of private actors (i.e., markets) to reach desirable outcomes; 2) to regulate markets to influence their outcomes; or 3) in an attempt to achieve a particular normative vision of what society ought to be like.  This course assumes that the public policy landscape is complex but still comprehensible given the proper set of analytical frameworks and appropriate historical background.  Particular emphasis will be placed on: changing views about the authority of the government to intervene in economic and social issues; the best way to balance individual and collective interests; and the variability within society of the life courses of individuals.  Topics to be covered include: immigration, health care and health insurance, and drug policy.<br />

Without neglecting the textual canon, we are particularly interested in changing styles of ritual organization and practice. We examine mutual borrowing and competition among shamanism, ancestor worship, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, and the adaptation of each to varying social contexts and state policies up to the present. Much of the material is in the form of original sources including descriptive accounts introduced by religious historians, and fiction. The last half of the course utilizes ethnography of Taiwan and Mainland China to account for the current flourishing of religion.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Cultural anthropologists "make the strange familiar and the familiar strange," attempting to understand the internal logic of cultures which might, at first glance, seem bizarre to us, while at the same time probing those aspects of our own society which might appear equally bizarre to outsiders. In doing so, anthropology makes us more aware of our own culturally-ingrained assumptions, while broadening our understanding of the possibilities and alternatives in human experience. This course will use ethnographic writings (descriptive accounts of particular cultures), as well as ethnographic films, to investigate the ways in which diverse societies structure family life, resolve conflict, construct gender relations, organize subsistence, etc. We will assess the advantages and pitfalls of comparing cross-cultural data, analyze the workings of power within and between societies, and consider the politics of cultural representations. We will also discuss the anthropologist's relationship to the people s/he studies, and the responsibilities inherent in that relationship. Throughout the course, students will learn the importance of an historical perspective on culture, looking at how and why societies change, and considering how we, as anthropologists, should assess these changes.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Value is a universal human concern, one that is as much spiritual and aesthetic as it is material. However, objects of value are produced, exchanged, circulated, consumed and understood in profoundly different ways. This course is an introduction to the anthropological study of objects of value in a variety of cultural and historical contexts. We will begin by considering how anthropologists have understood the exchange of objects as gifts, both in societies in which the exchange of objects as commodities is non-existent or rare, and in societies in which gift exchanges persist alongside or even within a commercial economy. Then, after considering the forms of barter and exchange that occurred during European expansion, conquest and colonization, we will explore commodity exchange, commodity fetishism, and money, in both Western and non-Western contexts. Finally, we will consider how anthropologists have explored the contemporary politics of value, addressing such issues as: globalization; migration and the "dollarization" of economies in Latin America and Eastern Europe; local, national and global political and economic crisis; and the emergence of new kinds of commodities and money, such as the Euro.<br />

This course proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the relationship between memory and history, as it is reflected by the cultural and historical analyses of 20th century Europe, as well as by broader historiographical and conceptual debates at a global scale.  The first part will first address some of the most important theoretical concerns about the relationship between memory-making and history-writing. The second part of the course will focus on the relationship between history and memory in 20th century Europe. We will approach the relationship between history and memory by exploring how memory itself began to matter in 20th century Europe; how different groups have started to mobilize their remembrances of the past for political and economic ends; and how individual testimonies, as innovative forms of expression, have challenged history writing as a genre, as well as made conceptually powerful topics such as the body, experience, trauma, and nostalgia.<br />

We will also consider representations of the islands in media other than text, films, for instance, and visual arts. The goal is to explore the complexity of a place that is often stereotyped as "paradise," but exemplifies problems of conquest and commercialization, of ethnic groups and boundaries, of commercialization and globalization, and of identity politics and independence movements.

First, we will consider twentieth-century anthropological attempts to develop ways of appreciating and understanding objects from other cultures, and in the process to reconsider the meaning of such terms as "art" and "aesthetics." Then we will discuss several topics in the history of empire and the "exotic" arts, including: the conquest, colonization and appropriation of indigenous objects; the politics of display and the rise of museums and world fairs; the processes by which locally-produced art objects are transformed into commodities traded in international art markets; the effects of "exotic" art on such aesthetic movements as surrealism, etc.; and the appropriation of indigenous aesthetic styles by "Western" artists. Finally, we will consider attempts by formerly colonized populations to reclaim objects from museums, and to organize new museums, aesthetic styles, and forms of artistic production that challenge imperialism's persistent legacies.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />For two centuries Europe and America shaped a global order. Economic, social, and political interdependences between states always existed. But these interdependencies did not limit their power to shape the 'world of nation states.' Today, however, at the beginning of the 21st century, the capacities of sovereign states, to exert power and pursue their policies unilaterally, come up against the limits posed by rapidly increasing independencies. Global financial markets, global migration, climate change, and global information networks stand for this development.    For some historians and political scientists the loss of boundary control indicates the erosion of the traditional concept of the sovereign nation state. Other scholars insist on the sovereign nation state as the indispensible pillar of any future global order.     We will approach this debate about the future of the sovereign nation states by first looking back on its rise in the 18th and 19th centuries. In a second step we will use the knowledge we gained in the history section and examine the different state concepts of scholars who argue for new forms of  (international) governance, and those who seek to reassert the authority and capacity of nation states to decide  their policies on their own.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following.  Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, as pursued by Lewis Hine, while the other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz, founder of the elite Photo-Secession movement in the United States, who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul.  As such they were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.   This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Harry Callahan, Charles "Teenie" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Annie Leibovitz, Duane Michals, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others.

In order to understand the context of healing in cross-cultural perspective, we will problematize the boundaries between medicine and other arenas of social life: religion, politics, law, economics, etc. We will investigate issues of medical efficacy (what "works"?) by asking who or what is being healed in different kinds of medical practices, and we will consider the ways in which power and social control are exerted through medical discourses of various sorts. Finally, we will examine the history of medical anthropology from its "clinical" origins in international development, through anthropological critiques of clinical perspectives, to attempts to fuse clinical and critical approaches.

<dt class="keepwithnext">79-346 American Political Humor from Mark Twain to the Daily Show</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course takes a cultural approach to U.S. history since the Civil War, as seen by the nation's most astute and influential critics: its political humorists. Besides immortals like Mark Twain and contemporary novelist Don DeLillo, we will (re)discover the satirical yet hilarious voices of H.L. Mencken, Will Rogers, Dorothy Parker, Walt "Pogo" Kelly, Richard Pryor, Fran Lebowitz, and others through essays, novels, recordings and films. Throughout the term, we will collaborate in defining terms and learning a vocabulary we can use to discuss and write analytically about ephemeral, topical critiques that make us laugh in order to make us think. How does "humor" differ from "comedy" or from "jokes"? Beyond lampooning government or elections, what makes humor "political"? What are the relationships between politics and art? What can political humor reveal that we might not "get" by any other means? At its sharpest edges, humor addresses issues of class, gender and race in American life, and provokes alternative thinking about mass culture, consumerism, and conformity. To provide context and analytical resources for these themes, we will also read historical studies and relevant theories by Sigmund Freud, Luigi Pirandello, and Mary Douglas. Assignments include four analytical essays, entries in a collaborative online glossary, a brief oral report, and occasional short quizzes on assigned readings.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">79-352 Christendom Divided: The Protestant and Catholic Reformation 1450-1650</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />At the dawn of the sixteenth century, western Europeans still shared a common religion and identity as members of the Roman Catholic Church. Within less than two decades, this uniformity began to crumble, and the very fabric of western culture was irrevocably altered. By 1550, Europe was splintered into various conflicting churches, confessions, sects, and factions, each with its own set of truths and its own plan for reforming the church and society at large. This period of rapid and unprecedented change in western history is commonly known as the Reformation. Though this term has traditionally referred to the birth of Protestantism, it also encompasses the simultaneous renewal and reform that occurred within Roman Catholicism. This course will survey the Reformations of the sixteenth century, both Protestant and Catholic, examining the causes of the Reformation, the dynamics of reform, and its significance for western society and culture. In the process, we will analyze such on-going problems as religious persecution and the accommodation of dissent, the relationship between religion and politics, and the interactions between ideology and political, social, and economic factors in the process of historical change.<br />

We study the many ways that individuals constructed and used their religious identities to approach problems of public life. We examine continuities and changes in religious institutions as well as conflicts between churches and states. The course shows that, far from declining in importance during the processes of economic and political modernization, or becoming part of private life, religious beliefs and identities played an increasing critical role in public life. We approach the topic through case studies, beginning with the religious conflicts and settlement between church and state during the French revolution, Evangelical Christian participation in the anti-slavery movement in Britain, Protestant-Catholic rivalries in Germany, the power of the papacy in Italy, and the Dreyfus case in France. Students will have reading assignments from both primary and secondary sources.<br />

Energy procurement and expenditure in the US and climate change have been surprisingly linked over the nation's entire. Now is the time for CMU students to understand these relationships historically, technically and scientifically, and politically and geopolitically.

How are ideas of the rights and responsibilities of citizens different in nations across the world?  In what ways does the lived practice of being a citizen differ from ideal notion(s)?  In this course, we look at the history and development of the idea of citizenship in a cross-cultural perspective, focusing on the global interconnections that influence the forms that citizenship takes.  We will examine the roots of political citizenship in Western society, and compare these to other foundational notions of state-subject relationships (such as in the Ancient Near East and Ancient China).  We then consider the formation of European nation-states and the emergence of modern citizenships.  In the second half of the course, we use examples from across the world to think about how subjects experience citizenship in particular ways, paying special attention to the margins and borders of citizenship (refugees, migrants, internally displaced peoples, cultural minorities, economically disadvantaged communities, etc.).  The class is discussion-based, and students will complete short assignments and a final essay.<br />

We rarely turn the story the other way around, and consider the discoveries made by those who sailed on long journeys from those islands in and beyond the Pacific.  This course will take that "other" perspective, examining the voyages of exploration through which Pacific Islanders encountered the west.  Instead of privileging the west as the force of globalization, we will look at movements initiated, perpetuated, and valued by islanders.  The course will focus on islands whose encounters with the west led to major changes in culture, in social organization, and in the "telling" of history-on both sides of the encounters.

<dt class="keepwithnext">79-361 Protest, Propaganda, and the Public Sphere, 1500-1800</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The advent of the printing press created unprecedented opportunities for the spread of new ideas in early modern Europe. Throughout the period, Europeans harnessed the power of print to mobilize opinion and effect change. This new print culture, combined with powerful images and a lively mix of gossip, rumor, and popular song, played a pivotal role in the revolutionary changes of this dynamic age. This course explores the popular protests of the early modern era through the propaganda that fueled them: the pamphlets, ballads, rumors, and cartoons that spread the message of change and galvanized popular support. In particular, the course will focus on the role of such propaganda in three critical moments of early modern European history: the German Reformation, the English Civil War, and the French Revolution. In the process, we will explore such historical problems as the cultural consequences of the coming of the book, the impact of censorship, the emergence of the "public sphere," and the rise of popular politics and public opinion as recognized forces in European political life.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The growth of legal institutions and their expanding use in enforcing "social discipline" marked an important   and often controversial   development in consolidating the political authority of the emerging states of the early modern era.  This seminar will examine this process, looking at early modern European legal institutions and their role in defining and enforcing societal norms of conduct and belief.  We will examine how the shifting definitions of "crime" within the period reflected prevailing societal attitudes and anxieties toward perceived acts of deviance and persons on the margins of society.  In addition to the workings of governmental and legal institutions, we will also explore the ways in which early modern communities used informal social and economic sanctions to police communal standards, sometimes against the will of  the authorities. Assigned readings will address such topics as the early modern European civil, criminal, and ecclesiastical court systems, investigation and punishment of crime, criminalization of social deviance (witches, vagrants, religious minorities and other outcasts), and the legal enforcement of sexual morality and gender roles.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Observation, participation and direct experience of "the field" are hallmarks of anthropological ways of knowing, and their representation has played a foundational role in ethnographic writing both past and present. Yet reflexive and postmodernist explorations of these topics have triggered contentious debates over the nature of anthropology as a scientific or humanistic enterprise, and over its ethical, political and epistemological value. In this seminar, we will approach such questions through an exploration of the extremes of ethnographic fieldwork and writing. We will consider such topics as: the colonial history and politics of explorers and ethnographers; liminality and the place of extreme experience--such as cultural dislocation, violence, derangement, intoxication, sex, possession, and dreaming-in fieldwork and writing; field-notes as an ethnographic genre, and their relationship to "official" published ethnography; ethnographic surrealism and surrealist ethnography; the dimensions of sensory experience (visual, auditory, olfactory, etc.) in fieldwork and ethnography; collecting and the powers of "exotic" objects; inter-subjectivity and its implications; and experimentation with alternate ethnographic forms, such as autobiography, film, diary, and poetry. **Please Note**: students electing to take this class should have a background in anthropology.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Fifty years after Ghana, the first sub-Saharan African nation, gained its independence from colonial rule, African economies continue to rest on a fragile foundation. Entrepreneurs must play an important role in developing the African continent, because both African governments and foreign aid have overall failed. In the face of these myriad of internal and external constraints on economic development, the history of entrepreneurship and future potential for entrepreneurship is often overlooked. This course will show that sub-Saharan Africa is-and has been for centuries-a thriving place of business, despite the obstacles of war, political and economic instability, disease, and famine. It will also focus on the challenges, such as local, regional, and national integration, access to credit and capital accumulation, and debt burden that African economies faced in the past, present, and future. Lastly, it will focus on the strategies that entrepreneurs in Africa-local and foreign-have developed to circumnavigate these challenges-and the opportunities that they have created in spite of them. By taking a historical approach to the subjects of entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology in Africa, this course will define African entrepreneurship in a way that is rooted in Africans' historical experiences and use this definition to put Africa's current and future roles in the global economy into historical perspective.<br />

In addition to reading assignments, seminar discussions, and research papers in the history of music, students will be taken to the performances of the Pittsburgh Symphony, Pittsburgh Opera, and Chamber Music Society. A supplemental fee of a minimum of $275 will be charged to subsidize part of the considerable expense of purchasing tickets for concerts and performances.Prerequisite: Availability to attend musical events on several Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">79-397 Memoirs and Autobiography in Historical Context</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This seminar will discuss memoirs/autobiographies by Americans and Europeans  from the 18th-20th centuries. It will analyze the art of writing about the  self in social and political context: what do authors reveal and not reveal  about their lives? How have ethnicity, nationality, gender and social class  influenced writing about the self? How has it been shaped by historical  events such as war, revolution, and the Holocaust? Readings will include  (parts of) memoirs and autobiographies of public people, including political  leaders, philosophers, and artists, as well as by "ordinary" people who were  not famous (before the publication of their memoir or autobiography).  Assignments: eight 1-2 page response papers, one 5 page paper, and one 8-10  page final paper.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">79-398 Documenting the 1967 Arab-Israeli War</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course considers how historians practice their craft in interpreting great events with the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 serving as the case study. Students read recent scholarly accounts of the war and then check them against one another as well as a variety of primary source materials such as memoirs, documents, speeches, newspapers, maps, eye-witness reports and UN resolutions. We will constantly be asking if the sources support the secondary accounts or if there are other interpretations that might lead to different conclusions. We will be examining the texts for tangents left unexplored and possibly worthy of further research. Students should expect a significant reading load, frequent assignments and a major final research paper on a 1967 War-inspired topic.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">79-400 Advanced Seminar in Global Studies</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 12 units<br />This research seminar is the capstone course for Global Studies majors. The course is designed to give you a chance to define and carry out a research project of personal interest. The first few weeks of the course will be devoted to developing a research topic and locating sources. We will then work on how to interpret and synthesize sources into a coherent and compelling thesis or argument before you begin drafting your paper. Your research may be based on in-depth reading of a body of scholarly work, field notes from ethnographic observations, archival research, analysis of literary or visual media, or some combination of these sources. Incorporation of some non-English language sources is strongly encouraged where possible. Independent work, self-initiative, participation in discussion, and peer evaluations are required. There are several interim deadlines that will be strictly enforced in order to ensure successful completion of the course. Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=79-275" title="79-275" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '79-275');">79-275</a> and Theoretical and Topical Core must be complete or concurrently enrolled.

<dt class="keepwithnext">79-411 Research on Great Islamic Issues According to the Early Sources</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course is ONLY offered at Carnegie Mellon in Qatar.  The term Islam suggests centuries of history that embody a creed and a civilization with unity and diversity in its rituals and politics. The Islamic world involves "great questions" that differentiate Muslims from one another. Examples include the Shia-Sunni schism or split that has divided Islamdom since the first decades after the death of the Prophet founder in 632; the tensions between unity and sectarianism that relentlessly explode in Muslim countries; the persisting questions of equality and inequality that pertain to gender and race. The works of such historians as Muhammad ibn Ishaq of Medina (704-769), who authored an early biography (Sirat Rasul Allah,Life of the Messenger of Allah), Muhammad ibn Saad of Basra (764-845), who was inspired by Ibn Ishaq,  the historian Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir Al-Tabari (839-923), who authored the multi-volume Tarikh al-rasul wa al muluk (History of the Prophets and Kings),and  the  14th-century eminent thinker, Abu Zayd Muhammad Ibn Khaldun, who wrote the Muqaddimah, an Introduction to History, and numerous contemporary scholars help to elucidate part of the problems. Exploring these texts improves the students' grasp of history.  This course will be taught as a proseminar that aims at introducing the literature in the English translation and at raising questions.  It will broaden deepen the appreciation of history by undergraduate students. As a "specialized" offering reserved for students minoring in history or having successfully completed two courses in history or having the authorization of the instructor, it will meet once a week for 2 and half hours and will discuss at length the sources and the questions.<br />

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />The purpose of this one-semester research seminar is to help you conceptualize, design, organize, and execute a substantial historical research project that will embody and extend the knowledge and skill set you have been developing as an undergraduate History major at Carnegie Mellon.  The identification and collection of relevant primary source data, and the positioning of your project within a relevant historiography, are integral parts of this intellectual task.     Along the way, we will strive to hone your written and oral presentation skills, deepen your command of research methodologies and strategies, and sharpen your abilities as a constructive critic of others' research.  The seminar seeks to develop these intellectual skills through a combination of in-class, student-led discussions of everyone's research-in-progress, and regular individual consultations with me.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=79-200" title="79-200" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '79-200');">79-200</a> or 79-360.<br />

This could include an organization that supports projects in other countries, works with immigrants in the Pittsburgh area, or participates in international policy making/governance. We strongly encourage students to seek out opportunities that require use of a second language. Students will be required to maintain a weekly journal; write a short critical reflection on how the internship connects to academic work; and share their experience with other Global Studies majors. Global Studies advisor and director will assist students with matching their interests to local organizations and identifying an on-site supervisor available to collaborate in the ongoing and final evaluation of the student's work. Prerequisite: Students must be Global Studies majors and obtain permission for the proposed internship from the Global Studies advisor.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />FALL 2014  France's (Dirty) Secrets: Constructing a Nation's Identity  When someone says "France", what do people normally think of? Cheese, wine, and baguettes? Kings and queens, great literature, painting, and sculpture? Probably not mentioned is the exportation of French Jews at the hands of the Vichy government. Conversely, what do people outside of the United States think of when someone says ?America?? Each nation has its own secrets, positive and negative. Through theories concerning ?imagined communities? and ?mythologies?, we will explore how France?s identity is developed for exportation and even internal consumption. Social constructionism, spread both internally and externally via mass media, can fool outsiders about the (dirty) secrets that nations hide. Unfortunately, these secrets are sometimes hidden even from those belonging to that very nation. No knowledge of French or France is required for this course.

<dt class="keepwithnext">82-184 Freshman Seminar: The Birth and Death of Tragedy</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This is a freshman seminar, taught in English, and it addresses one of the most important questions in the development of Western culture: what is tragedy, how did it evolve, and what does it mean today?  Starting with Aischeles' Oresteia and Aristotle's Poetics, the seminar explores the nature of tragedy in ancient Greece as a theatrical experience, a literary form, and an expression of Greek culture.  Friedrich Nietzsche's essay The Birth of Tragedy offers an interpretation of the meaning of tragedy in its original context and a link to the nature of tragedy in the modern world.  Richard Wagner's music drama Tristan und Isolde and his theoretical essays, including "Art and Revolution" and "The Art-Work of the Future," further illustrate and develop the theme, showing how a dominant representative of nineteenth century culture sought to reevaluate and reclaim the tragic form, linking it with an extensive critique of modern culture.  Thomas Mann's Death in Venice provides an early twentieth century variation on the theme of tragedy, and Sigmund Freud's Civilization and its Discontents, like Nietzsche's essay, provides a framework for placing tragedy in its cultural context.  Finally, Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman provides a modern American version of the problem of tragedy.  Students in this seminar are asked to write short papers every two to three weeks, and the in-class focus is on intensive discussion and analysis of the texts.  Prerequisite: Freshman status.<br />

Student researchers will assist in: a) identifying, locating, and reviewing major examples of comics from the Hispanic world; b) identifying and selecting canonic and recent theoretical and critical readings about the comic genre in the Hispanic world to contribute to a literature review; c) analyzing and categorizing comics according to given criteria.  Some of the texts are originally written in English or are available in translation, but most are in Spanish. Possible long-term results of this project include a course of study built around this research, and perhaps a published work (for which student participants would be acknowledged as contributors).  Open to one or two students with at least advanced intermediate level reading skills in Spanish.   Section B: Online Language and Culture Course This project will have two parts. The first will continue to study the data from the French Online course offered at Carnegie Mellon, data examined in spring and summer 2014 but which will need further analysis. The data for this course should allow us to determine how students have used the program in the past. A second part of the course will be the implementation of a research study with students in the French Online course in order to link the data with actual student behaviors when learning online.

Intriguingly, its renaissance involves a strong tendency to revisit and reassess a variety of historical traumas from the last century, which makes it an important venue for discussing the evolution of modern Korean society and culture.  This course thus explores works of acclaimed filmmakers such as Im Kown-taek, Park Kwang-su, Jang Sun-woo, Hong Sang-soo, Lee Chang-dong, Park Chan-wook, Bong Joon-ho, Kim Ji-woon, etc. to enrich our understanding of social and cultural formations in South Korea over the last century.

This course covers a broad range of time periods: the colonial era to the present.  Yet designed to inspire critical approach rather than just offer sketchy overviews, it is structured around key sociocultural issues such as colonial legacies, the cold war paranoia, dictatorship, democratization, national culture, gender politics, diaspora, globalization, hallyu (k-pop/k-drama), etc.  To better serve its objectives, this course also utilizes diverse forms of texts: historical studies, critical essays, literary works, films, TV dramas, and music videos.<br />

Steady development of the country's literature and art in the 19th century was followed by three decades of free avant-garde experimentation (1900?1930), which revolutionized our view of verbal, visual, and musical art and had lasting influence on the Western mind.  The course will survey the works of Kandinsky, Malevich, Diaghilev, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Andrei Bely, Meyerhold, Eisenstein, Vladimir Nabokov, their theories of art and their impact.  It will place the Russian avant-garde into a larger context of 20th-21st century Western culture.  The instructor's own experience as a writer, experimental film director, and historian of music will further relate the discussion to issues important for us now.    Prereq: None.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">82-343 Latin America: Language and Culture</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br />In this course we will explore Latin American culture and language focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of  ?who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996). These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970?s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. However, it is important to point out that there is no suggestion of continuity or unique experience that represents the diverse groups and societies that constitute Latin America. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and certain controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larraín 1996).  The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring through out the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?, How does Latin America think of itself?, What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

All work in this course, in the five skill areas, will be stimulated by and be the product of an advanced introduction to and analysis of the cultures and histories of the Hispanic peoples in the United States of America. Many of these people have been and are native born; others are descendants of natives and/or colonizers who resided in North America prior to the arrival of Anglo-Germanic peoples. Many have migrated from Mexico, the Hispanic Caribbean, Central and South America, and Spain during the past two centuries, for economic and/or political reasons. Still others have migrated under special circumstances, as exiles escaping from repressive regimes or from wars in their homelands. Our exploration of U.S. Latino history and culture will compare and contrast the experiences of Hispanics from all three of the above-described categories and analyze the dynamic tension amongst them, with other minority groups, and with the mainstream society.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />FALL 2014  HISPANIC LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES: Reading Hispanic Comics: Superheroes and Beyond   Despite often being despised and marginalized by intellectual and educated observers, comics and graphic novels have been steadily informing and transforming the Spanish, Latin American, and Latino mass-media and cultural landscapes for decades. How/What can representations of heroes, superheroes, and villains in comics tell us about the Spanish-speaking world? In order to answer these questions, the course offers a survey of popular comics and graphic novels from the Hispanic/Latino world, and provides the skills for reading these works critically as cultural artifacts in terms of what they say and how they say it. We will also use these texts to investigate Spanish, Latin American, and Latino popular culture, narrative, history, and society; their connections with literary texts, socio-historical and cultural contexts, and economic systems; how issues of race, ethnicity, gender and class are addressed in the genre; the (blurring of the) boundaries between the highbrow and the lowbrow; utopias and dystopias; etc. In addition to reading and examining multiple examples of the genre, we will also read materials that will help deepen our understanding of the historical context in which each work was produced, as well as critical theory. Expectations include diligent reading, active participation, written responses, creative and analytical writing, and a final research project.

We will adopt multiple points of view, including not only song as music and lyrics, but song as an event in a socio-historical context, as performance, as an industry, as a means of cultural promotion, as a focus for technical innovation in instrumentation, recording, sound reinforcement, and distribution.  Where appropriate we will study and listen to individual artists or groups who exemplify trends in these areas.    The second half of the course will move our attention to a survey of regional development, beginning with France, then Quebec and finishing with the Cajun music of Louisiana, in what we hope is not a nod in memoriam to an important part of American culture.

How do French and foreign authors and filmmakers choose to represent the City of Light? Which aspects of Parisian life do these voices focus on, and why? How do these representations influence French and global perceptions of the city? Drawing from the study of myths by Roland Barthes and Claude Lévi-Strauss, as well as images in poetry, novels, films and popular culture, we will look at the ?production? of Paris. We will contrast mainstream images of the city (a place for lovers and baguettes, the Louvre, Notre Dame) with a lesser-known side of the city, from its catacombs to its ethnic neighborhoods and ?banlieues.? We will also examine the relations between Americans and Paris, from the works of writers such as Ernest Hemingway to the current perceptions of the city conveyed by/in American popular culture. Readings will include Baudelaire?s Le Spleen de Paris, Victor Hugo?s Les Misérables, Mireille Guiliano?s Ces Françaises qui ne grossissent pas, and Alain Mabanckou?s Bleu Blanc Rouge.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course, conducted entirely in German, provides a basic introduction to the literature of Enlightenment, Sturm und Drang, and classicism in Germany during the second half of the eighteenth century and at the beginning of the nineteenth century.  Classical literature appeared in Germany at a later date than in the other major European countries; for this reason German classical literature tends to be more accessible linguistically to contemporary readers than some other classical literatures.  The course will begin with the remarkably lucid and relevant work of Lessing, in particular his plays Emilia Galotti and Nathan der Weise--both programmatic statements of Enlightenment rationality and critical bourgeois consciousness.  We will then move on to the brief but important Sturm und Drang period, exploring Goethe's revolutionary novel Die Leiden des jungen Werther, Schiller's radical drama Die Räuber, and Lenz's disturbing play Der Hofmeister.  The focus will be on Sturm und Drang as a uniquely German phenomenon, and on the reasons for its rapid development and quick demise.  Our exploration of classical literature will culminate with Goethe's Faust I, one of the great masterpieces of western literature and probably the most celebrated and influential work in the German literary canon.  We will also devote time to close reading and aesthetic appreciation of some of Goethe's most beautiful poems.  An examination of Schiller's letters Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen will round out our exploration of German classicism as an idealistic aesthetic movement.  Students will be asked to complete five brief writing assignments over the course of the semester, and to take midterm and final examinations.

Germany is particularly famous for its Romantic culture, and in fact tens of thousands of people all over the world get married every year to the music of German Romantic composers like Richard Wagner and Felix Mendelssohn ("Here Comes the Bride" and the Wedding March, respectively).

It moves from the silent cinema of the 1910s to the Weimar Republic, when German cinema represented Hollywood's greatest challenger in the international cinema world.  It then addresses the cinema of Hitler's so-called "Third Reich," when German cinema dominated European movie theaters, and moves on to the cinema of divided Germany from 1949-1989, when cinema in the socialist east and cinema in the capitalist west developed in very different ways.  In the final week of the semester, we will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest.  The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called "New German Cinema" of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood.  Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.  No knowledge of the German language is required for this course; most of the films will be in German with English subtitles.

Ever since it was published, the comic book series has become a great hit in Taiwan and Mainland China, and has been translated into different languages around the world.   While its popularity continues to grow among its readers, its wide circulation also raises questions among scholars and critics of traditional Chinese literature and culture.  Two questions are usually brought up in the discussion of the value of this comic book series: (1) Are the comic adaptations faithful to the meanings of the original Chinese works? (2) Does the popularity of this comic series really help to promote the understanding and transmission of traditional Chinese culture?   One goal of this course is to look into these two questions.  In this course, students will be asked to read Tsai Chih Chung?s comic books and their animated adaptations, as well as the English translations of the Chinese canonical texts of philosophy and literature.  While enjoying Tsai?s innovative and delightful comic interpretation, students will also need to ponder upon serious philosophical questions along with the early Chinese thinkers, to learn to savor the aesthetic beauty of traditional Chinese literature, and to prepare to share their ideas and discovery to the rest of the class in Chinese.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=82-332" title="82-332" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '82-332');">82-332</a></dd>

Students will read canonical and non-canonical Golden Age Literature and will put special attention to the various social, racial and cultural identities frequently perceived as minority, marginal, or secondary. Whereas literary theory and historical readings will be included in the course, the bulk of readings will be literary texts, including known authors like Fernando de Rojas, Lope de Vega, Tirso de Molina, Cervantes and Teresa de Jesus, among others.  This course will initiate a discussion about the ways in which these ?other? identities: the witch, the whore, the queer, the marrano, the morisco, the heretic, the pícaro, the alumbrado and the ?in-between? identities were employed and crafted during the period. We will explore how hybridity plays a role in their categorization vis a vis the ideologies of pureza de sangre, pureza de raza, pureza de lengua. These voices appeared prominently in a wide variety of narratives and this course seeks to explore the range of literary and narrative adaptations and techniques employed to push ?other? voices to the forefront of narratives, and thus exposing a Siglo del ?Otro? instead of a Siglo de Oro.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The purpose of the course is to explore the biographical facts, political circumstances and cultural histories underlying the paradoxical and poignant trajectory of Joseph Brodsky's outstanding achievements as poet, playwright, essayist and spokesman for literature's value to ethics and education.  His work is deeply rooted in the artistic efflorescence of the "Silver Age" in twentieth century Russian poetry, but takes equal inspiration in the metaphysical poetry of England's Renaissance and Modern ages.  To read Brodsky is thus to read Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva and Osip Mandelshtam, on the one hand, and John Donne, George Herbert, T.S. Eliot, and W.H. Auden on the other.  Works by and about these authors as well as Brodsky thus comprise the reading matter of the course.  Poetry, essays and literary criticism are read with a view toward textual explication as a starting point for engaging the larger issues by which any literature subsists.  To study the career of this most unusual writer in its bilingual, bicultural context is to confront the most fundamental questions about the means by which cultures are empowered and the reasons for which they succeed or fail to coexist in any given place and time.  The language of the course is English for all readings, lectures and discussions.  No knowledge of Russian is required, but those who can are invited to read in Russian as well.  The course follows a predominantly seminar format.  Reading and writing assignments are required, as is participation in classroom discussion.  Prerequisite: None.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">82-585 Topics in Second Language Acquisition</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />SECTION A: Pragmatics, an area within linguistics, is concerned with how people use language in a social context and why they use it in particular ways. People have a variety of ways of communicating their ideas in social interaction. Among many expressions, they choose particular ones based on who they are talking to, and under what situation the conversation is taking place. The contextual factors, along with knowledge of communication conventions, also help people comprehend messages that are often indirectly conveyed. Hence, learning a second language (L2) involves more than learning a system of grammar and lexis. Understanding the rules of speaking and the social situations of the conversation in addition to grammatical rules are important factors in order to become a fully competent speaker in the target language culture. This course aims to enhance students? understanding of pragmatics in their every day communication, as well as challenges and opportunities that learners face in the course of their L2 pragmatic development. The first part of the course helps students develop techniques to analyze how people perform pragmatic functions in real life communication. The techniques are drawn from frameworks within traditional pragmatic theories and conversation analysis. The second part of the course examines the application of pragmatic theories to SLA research in three broad domains: pragmatic constructs & research methods, development of pragmatic competence, and pedagogical issues. Through critical examinations of the literature in these three areas, students will develop an understanding of the role of pragmatics in SLA research and teaching.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-100 Introduction to Philosophy</dt>
<dd>All Semesters: 9 units<br />In this introductory course we will explore three major areas of Philosophy: Ethics, Metaphysics, and Epistemology. Accordingly the course is divided into three sections. In each section we will read primary sources and discuss some of the main philosophic problems associated with that area. These will include: moral problems (Ethics), problems rising from the debates about free-will, personal identity or intelligence (Metaphysics), and inquiries about the scope and limits of human knowledge (Epistemology). We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why.<br />

Topics include the development of non-Euclidean geometry and Riemann's theories of manifolds with applications in cosmology, and the theory of computability with applications in cognitive psychology. Students will become familiar with fundamental set theoretic notions, as well as Turning machines and cellular automata.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-109 Philosophy Freshman Seminar: Perspectives on Climate Change</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />The earth's climate has gone through many changes.  Sorting through   all the predictions and discussion about the changes in climate this   generation will experience can be overwhelming.  In this course we   will look at questions about how to respond to climate change from   several perspectives:  history of the earth sciences, philosophy of   science (what can we know?, how do we know?, what should we ask   next?), and philosophical ethics.  Answering such questions well   relies in part on getting the facts straight, so we will also look at   what scientists have to say on some relevant questions, such as:  Has life on the earth ever recovered from a rapid catastrophic   climatic event, and if so, how?  What role do plants and animals,   forests and deserts, oceans and marshlands play in creating and   maintaining    earth's atmosphere?   Then we will consider ethical issues, such as:  What should we aim for: mitigation of climate change or adaptation to   climate change --- or both?  How much should the interests of future   generations be valued in making decisions today. and what principles   or considerations are relevant in deciding this?  Is it still worth   pursuing global cooperation, or should such efforts instead focus on   more regionally oriented aims?  Are there successful stories of   responding to climate change, and if so, what morals can we draw from   them?.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-110 Nature of Mathematical Reasoning</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course focuses on understanding mathematical reasoning, not on mastering a particular mathematical theory like linear algebra or calculus. It explores instances of mathematical reasoning and rigorous argumentation, with examples from the history of science and mathematics. We consider the "Lets Make a Deal" puzzle, the counter-intuitive results of HIV testing, and how to assess the relative size of infinite sets, all problems which defy intuitive solution but which look simple after they are put in mathematical form. The course is designed for students at the freshman and sophomore levels who are not interested in a mathematically intense major.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-130 Introduction to Ethics</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course provides both a historic and thematic survey of western ethical theory. Key figures such as Aristotle, Hobbes, Kant, Mill, and Nietzsche will be presented as background to the thematic problems of relativism, egoism, and other concepts in ethical theory. Students will take part in the creative process of developing skills necessary to engage in reflective moral reasoning. This process will culminate in the use of interactive multimedia modules simulating real world scenarios involving difficult moral choices. Participating in a class ethics committee will provide students with opportunities for personal reflection on the ways moral reasoning can be used to expand our understanding of hard choices and moral dilemmas.<br />

</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">80-135 Introduction to Political Philosophy</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />As an introductory course, we will seek to trace out the historical and philosophical dimensions of the polis from its origins in Ancient Greece to its current manifestation in present-day society. Special emphasis will be placed on the concept of "democracy." The readings and lectures will focus on the history and concept of democracy (as an idea and as an institution); the basic concepts and problems of political philosophy (e.g., liberal and libertarian ideas of justice); and applied political philosophy (e.g., regional initiatives in deliberative democracy).<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">80-136 Social Structure, Public Policy  &amp; Ethics</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The course will consider ethical questions that arise regarding social structure and public policy's impact on both people and the environment. It will consider the role of political institutions (and, sometimes, individuals) in dealing with some of the greatest challenges facing our generation: World poverty, environmental problems, and globalization. Some of the questions we will consider include: Are developed countries like ours obligated to ameliorate poverty by providing foreign aid, are they obligated to prevent environmental problems, and is globalization and free trade in particular a good idea? The course uses theory, case studies, and empirical evidence to consider these questions from a few different moral and political perspectives. We will extract some economic principles and rational dilemmas from examining these issues and pay attention to how legal and empirical considerations interact with ethical considerations.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-150 Nature of Reason</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course offers an intellectual history of philosophical views regarding the nature of human reasoning in mathematics and the sciences, from ancient to modern times. The first part of the course traces the search for deductive methods for obtaining certain knowledge, starting with Aristotle and Euclid, and continuing through the Middle Ages and late Renaissance thought, to the work of Boole and Frege in the nineteenth century. The second part of the course considers the history of skepticism about empirical knowledge, covering Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Descartes, Pascal, and Hume, along with replies to skepticism in the works of Bayes and Kant. The third part of the course discusses theories of the nature of mind, culminating in the computational conception of mind that underlies contemporary cognitive science.<br />

<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br />Language is used to talk about the world or to describe it, but how do we go about describing language itself? Linguistics is the name given to the science of language, whose task it is to give such a description.   The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them.   Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Beyond this, we look at changes in language over time, and we consider the puzzle of linguistic meaning. The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-195 Research Training</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br />This course is part of a set of 100-level courses offered by H&SS departments as independent studies for students in the College. In general, these courses are designed to give students some real research experience through work on a faculty project or lab in ways that might stimulate and nurture subsequent interest in research participation. Faculty and students devise a personal and regularized meeting and task schedule. Each Research Training course is worth 9 units, which generally means a minimum for students of about 9 work-hours per week. These courses are offered only as electives; i.e., they cannot be applied toward a college or major requirement, although the units do count toward graduation as elective units. Additional details (including a roster and descriptions of Research Training Courses available in any given semester) are available in the H&SS Academic Advisory Center. For H&SS students only; only for second-semester freshmen, or first- or second-semester sophomores; minimum cumulative QPA of 3.0 (at the time of registration) required for approved entry; additional prerequisites (e.g., language proficiency) may arise out of the particular demands of the research project in question.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Epistemology, one of the cornerstones of philosophy since ancient times, concerns the relationships between belief, truth, and knowledge. This course will explore fundamental issues in epistemology, such as the analysis of the concept of knowledge, epistemic justification and scientific method, a priori knowledge, theories of truth, skepticism, reliabilism, and coherentism. Both classic texts and contemporary journal articles will be discussed. There are no prerequisites, but students with some philosophical sophistication and/or formal ability will be more comfortable with the material.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course is an introduction to practical reasoning. The course will contain an elementary introduction to concepts important for reasoning and decision making, such as validity, probability, and utilities. Students will extensively practice critically analyzing and evaluating a wide variety of arguments found in newspapers, magazines, and elementary accounts of scientific reasoning. In order to help students develop the skills to analyze and evaluate arguments, the course will introduce several software packages recently developed at CMU that help students diagram arguments and causal reasoning; these packages have been shown to improve students critical reasoning skills. In addition, students will learn about a wide variety of statistical, logical, psychological, and causal fallacies that are used to mislead people.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-210 Logic and Proofs</dt>
<dd>All Semesters: 9 units<br />This web-based course introduces students to central issues in logic and develops their ability for constructing and refuting arguments. It addresses the question: How can one analyze the structure of rational discourse or, more specifically, the logical structure of argumentation? An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules. The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic. Presentation: The material is presented on-line, though some exercises must be done with pen and paper. Additional reading of historical and philosophical character complements the systematic on-line presentation. Weekly small discussion meetings with collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections supplement the on-line material.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-211 Logic and Mathematical Inquiry</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Since ancient times, those searching for truth have looked to mathematical arguments as a paradigm of rational inquiry. We study the structure of such arguments and their application. In the first half of the course, we develop the syntax and semantics of sentential and quantificational logic while in the second, we apply this logic to examine the axiomatic method in set theory and introduce formal models of computation. This course prepares students to take the 310-311 series on the fundamental (in)completeness and (un)decidability theorems of modern logic.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-212 Arguments and Logical Analysis</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Are there rational methods that can further our knowledge? The notion of rational inquiry presupposes that there are appropriate methods for the pursuit of knowledge. In this course, we will investigate the means by which a successful argument justifies its conclusion, as well as various subtle ways in which other arguments fail. In the course of our inquiry, we will take a historically informed approach to studying logic and argumentative fallacies. We will also discover that these tools are useful for constructing and analyzing arguments in all disciplines from philosophy and history to psychology and physics. Our primary goal is to learn to use these tools to make our thinking and writing clearer, more precise, and more critical. To that end, our coursework will consist in homework and exams on topics in logic, as well as essays on a wide variety of topics. This course is intended for students from any discipline who would like to improve their writing and critical thinking skills.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />In this course, we will examine some historical case studies (e.g., the Copernican revolution in astronomy) against which we will assess views pertaining to the significance, justification, and production of scientific knowledge. For example, should scientific theories be understood literally or as computational devices for deriving new predictions? How can universal conclusions ever be justified by a finite data set? Does explanation contribute to a theory's confirmation by the evidence? Does science aim to find the truth? Is probability in the world or only in our minds? Is explanation a matter of finding causes or are causes whatever it is that explains? Is scientific rationality objective or culture-relative?.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-221 Philosophy of Social Science</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This course will explore various philosophical issues germane to social science. The central question of the course asks whether we can use traditional scientific tools to understand social phenomena, e.g. wars and religions, in the same way that we use them to understand natural phenomena, e.g. gases, lasers and planetary orbits.  Some of the more specific questions we address: Because humans possess free will and act with intentions while light rays and planets in motion do not, are we forced to use logically different species of explanations in the two cases? How can we explain social institutions that depend upon cooperation? Whereas natural scientists actively conduct experiments, social scientists can often only collect statistical data. Does this difference prevent social scientists from inferring causal relations? Is our understanding of social phenomena always value laden?.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-226 Revolutions in Science</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Contemporary science emerged in the 17th century from a series of dramatic innovations in theory and method that has come to be called the Scientific Revolution. Since then, science has been punctuated by repeated 'revolutions' in which scientists have been forced to select among dramatically different frameworks for explaining the world: is the Earth or the sun at the center of the solar system? Do kinds of organisms develop from other kinds, or is each created independently? Is matter infinitely divisible or are all things made of atoms in a void? The way scientists choose one framework over another can tell us something about the nature of science. In this course, we will focus on episodes of scientific change to gain insight into a range of questions:  Is scientific change governed by a single method or does each new revolution involve the invention of a new scientific method? How do scientists argue for the existence of unobservable processes, properties, or objects like atoms? In what way do these arguments differ from those of their ancient predecessors? What makes them compelling? We'll begin our investigation by examining the overthrow of ancient Greek astronomy and physics by Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. We will then turn to a number of subsequent revolutions in other areas of science such as chemistry, geology, and evolutionary biology. Students will work with original texts by Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and others.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-230 Ethical Theory</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Every day, even in very subtle ways, we make judgments of value that shape our lives and our conduct. This course will examine four influential attempts at providing a systematic account of the source and nature of moral value, its relationship to other kinds of value, and the practical implications of different answers to these questions. This focus on the fundamental structure of moral value will frequently engage topics such as the nature of the good, subjectivist and objectivist accounts of value, forms of moral naturalism verses attempts at moral constructivism, and will draw on historical as well as more contemporary  sources. Particular attention will be paid to articulating the specific sources of disagreement that distinguish competing moral theories in order to facilitate our ability to adjudicate between them on a reasoned basis.<br />

How, and under what circumstances do individuals incur special political obligations to a particular state? What are the limits of the legitimate authority of the state and how are they defined? This course provides a systematic investigation of the way such questions are answered by dominant schools of liberal political theory, such as the social contract tradition, utilitarianism and libertarianism. Because the liberal political tradition is also strongly egalitarian in nature, the course will examine different conceptions of political equality and conflicting views about the respects in which community members may have a just claim to equal treatment. Readings are drawn from classic works by authors such as Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and Mill, and from the works of contemporary theorists like Rawls, Nozick and others.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The aim of the course is to provide students with an introduction to environmental ethics. One aspect of environmental ethics is the study of values underlying human relations to the natural environment. In particular, we are interested in issues that arise when these values conflict. This course begins with a discussion of our current environmental crises, and different approaches to solving these crises. Many of these solutions, however, depend on particular kinds of knowledge, particularly scientific knowledge, about our environment. Thus, another important aspect of environmental ethics is determining what we do, and what we can, know. To address these issues, we will explore some problems in philosophy of science, with special emphasis on the various eco-sciences.<br />

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />This course provides an introduction to core ethical issues in health care, medical research, and public policy. Topics include: the moral responsibilities of health care providers to patients and various third parties such as the government or insurance companies, the status of health as a social good, and questions of individual liberty and social responsibility at the ends of life including issues such as abortion, physician assisted suicide, and the definition of death. We will also examine specific ethical issues in the conduct of medical research and look at the impact of technological innovation on our notions of health, disease, life, death, and the family. If time permits, we may also discuss issues related to genetics and cloning. While the course engages such substantive ethical issues it also attempts to sharpen students' skills in practical reasoning through argument analysis, analogical reasoning, and the application of theory and principles to particular cases.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Moral psychology is the study of how we think about morality, make moral judgments, and behave in moral situations.  This has important implications for how we should think about morality, make moral judgments, and behave in moral situations.  In this course we will examine empirical research on moral thinking and behavior by psychologists, neuroscientists, economists, and philosophers and discuss the implications this research has for issues in ethics.   We will address questions such as: What motivates our moral behavior?  Do we ever act altruistically or do we only do the right thing because it's somehow in our own interest?  Is it even possible to tell what people's real motivations are?   How do we make moral judgments and decisions?  What roles do reason, intuition, and emotion play in our moral judgments?  What role should they play?   What role should a person's beliefs, desires, and intentions play in our judgments of how blameworthy the person is or of how much punishment he or she deserves?  What role should the outcomes of the person's actions play in our judgments of him or her?  Should we hold people responsible for things that are not entirely under their control?.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The course considers the secret lives of every day things -- like food, water, and oil. It suggests that it is by understanding these things that we can best address some of the greatest challenges facing our generation including world poverty and environmental problems. After a short introduction to arguments and ethical theory, the course considers how basic commodities like oil, water, and bananas have shaped and will continue to shape human and natural history. The course then outlines some of the environmental and social implications of the ways we create, use, and trade basic commodities. Finally, it considers prospects for dealing with some of the challenges posed by our past, present, and future use of these commodities. Global Economics and Ethics lays the groundwork for dealing with some of the most important issues facing our generation.<br />

We will prepare the background for Socrates and Plato by tracing the various historical and intellectual movements that led up to and through the flourishing and downfall of Periclean Athens. A study of Socrates (as represented in Aristophanes' comedy and Plato's early dialogues) will lead to an in-depth reading of Plato's Gorgias, Symposium and sections of the Republic. We will approach Aristotle through his 'practical philosophy' as presented in the Nicomachean Ethics. The final sections will discuss the Epicurean, Skeptic, and Stoic movements as well as the work of Cicero.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Descartes' project to doubt all received knowledge and begin from scratch marked the beginning of an intellectual upheaval, helping to launch what is now called the Modern period of philosophical thought; the Western world is today the heir of modernism. Locke, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant are several of the most important figures of this period. We will examine works of these thinkers, exploring both the new sorts of questions that these philosophers raised and their new methods of doing philosophy, which together mark a fundamental break with the traditions that preceded them. We will devote special attention to the new theories of knowledge they proposed and to their works in ethics and political philosophy. The philosophical revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries occurred during a time of great scientific progress and political upheaval in Europe; as part of our course we will consider the relation of certain of these developments to the new questions and methods of the modern philosophers and to their works in ethics and political philosophy.<br />

Early to mid-20th Century Continental Philosophy covers the central tenets of phenomenology and existentialism (e.g., intentionality, Being-in-the-World, Bad Faith). This part will involve selections from the works of, for example, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty.

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-254 Analytic Philosophy</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course examines the revolutionary impact of philosophy at the turn of the 20th century on contemporary thought and progress. By the 1920s some scientists and philosophers became hopeful that the end of the long tradition of philosophical deadlock was finally within reach. Buoyed in particular by Einstein?s theory of relativity and the invention of modern logic, they created a new kind of philosophy with the goal of applying logical and empirical methods to philosophical problems. This new approach led to new puzzles and paradoxes, along with a focus on the age old question of what can be known and what is meaningful. The modern fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and information and computer sciences all owe a debt to these sources, as does of course contemporary philosophy. Our quest will be to understand both what authors like Frege, Russell, and the Vienna Circle were up to in the first place, and how their work contributed to the world we live in today.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-255 Pragmatism</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />American Pragmatism represents an energetic attempt to bridge the divergent cultures of science and the humanities. The movement's founder, C.S. Peirce, was trained in chemistry and worked as a physicist, but he was also deeply concerned with the contemporary philosophical portrayal of science, which distinguished sharply between theoretical knowledge and practice. Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was also developed and vigorously popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirce's position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also well-known for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving. The pragmatists made and continue to make lasting contributions to modern statistics, logic, and social science and their emphases on community, fallibility, action, and value in science are still of primary importance in philosophy and in the ongoing dialogue between the scientific and humanistic cultures.<br />

The famous divide between the British empiricist philosophers and the rationalist philosophers of the Continent regarding the sources of human knowledge, was paralleled in a dispute regarding the nature of aesthetic judgments.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />During his life in the late 19th-century, Friedrich Nietzsche was a relatively obscure German philosopher. Since his death, however, he has become deeply influential and well-known, and was a source of inspiration for many important 20th-century thinkers. Despite this popularity, Nietzsche's philosophy remains relatively mysterious, and often misunderstood. Much of his writing consisted of aphorisms, rather than more traditional prose and arguments, and many of his positions seem to contradict one another. This course will cover a broad range of Nietzsche's writings, focusing on such central concepts as the will to power, eternal recurrence, and the oft-misunderstood Ubermensch ("overman"). Throughout, we will focus on developing a consistent interpretation of an enigmatic philosopher whose views have been mischaracterized and misappropriated throughout the past century.<br />

Specifically, we will focus on the problems encountered in trying to give an adequate account of the nature of the external world, the structure of our minds, and the nature and limitations of knowledge in the thought of Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley, and Hume. The course has two main goals: (1) to study the metaphysical and epistemological theories of selected philosophers, paying close attention to the arguments offered on behalf of often very strange positions, and (2) to help you improve your analytical and critical skills, including, for example, extracting and evaluating philosophical arguments.<br />

The issues we'll cover include several specific challenges in the Theory of Knowledge and Perception.  For example, What is the difference between appearance and reality, and can we tell?

How are these facets of subjectivity related to the objective, physical world? In this course, we tackle these challenging questions with a philosophical approach that highlights analysis and argument, though we will also bring in relevant empirical understanding of the mind and brain to enrich our discussion (a complementary course, Philosophy and Psychology, is taught in alternate years where the empirical issues are the focus with enrichment from philosophy).

Classical as well as contemporary philosophic texts will be studied.    For Spring 2011:  Issues we will consider, in no particular order, include: Do properties exist? Why should you think there is an external world? What is a number? Why should you think other people have mental states? What are natural kinds? What constitutes the identity of things through time? What constitutes the identity of persons through time? What does determinism mean? Is there freedom of the will? What is possibility? What is necessity? Are there other possible worlds?

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-280 Linguistic Analysis</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />At one level, language is constituted by nothing but sounds, or marks on paper. How can such physical objects be used to create or transmit meaning? The answer assumed in this course is that objects with specific physical features are assigned symbolic or linguistic values on the basis of those features. By the juxtaposition of such objects (phonemes or graphemes), larger symbolic objects are created (morphemes). Morphemes have the special property that they can be associated in a consistent way with meanings. In a progressive fashion, words are built from morphemes, phrases from words, and sentences from phrases. Sentences have different moods, and these moods correspond to their function with respect to the encoding and transmission of information. Indicative sentences carry information, interrogative sentences request information, imperative sentences demand action, conditional and modal sentences present alternative possibilities, and so on. The goal of this course is to investigate the structure of the linguistic entities by which these communicative functions are realized. Building on material taught in Nature of Language, we look in detail at the morphology and syntax of human languages, paying special attention to cross-linguistic variety.

In this course, we'll try to understand how that works, given that we cannot in fact take our thoughts out of our heads and show them to someone else. We'll explore different views on the relationship between thought and meaning, and different views about how language succeeds in communicating thoughts and ideas. We'll explore the idea of a language of thought, and ask whether the language we speak influences our thought. At the same time, we will want to understand how it is that language hooks up to the world, enabling us to talk not only about what we think, but also about the way things actually are. We'll look at the role of inference in language understanding, and at the nature of non-literal communication, in particular metaphor.

This is true within the speech of an individual, between sounds produced by different speakers of the same dialect, and across dialects within a language. Still, some sounds are considered by speakers to be the same as other sounds, and this is what makes communication with spoken language possible. On the flip side, some sounds must be recognized as different from some other sounds ? this is the phonological notion of contrast. Without contrast, sounds could not be combined together as morphemes which carry meaning. In this course students get hands-on practice in describing sounds in articulatory and acoustic terms (how they are made and what their physical properties are). We concentrate especially on vowels and sonorant consonants, using the spectrographic software Praat. We look at how complex sound waves are produced in the vocal folds and how these sound waves are modified in the vocal tract and nasal passages. These phonetic descriptions are then used to study the phonological systems of contrast within languages, and where and how contrasting sounds (phonemes) are modified (allophones). We look at earlier attempts to devise such phonological systems, and trace developments leading to modern optimality theory. In optimality theory, contrast and allophonic variation are explained in terms of an input-output device which selects a most harmonic candidate which is faithful enough in form to the phonemes in the input.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=80-180" title="80-180" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-180');">80-180</a></dd>

More generally, the course provides an examination of the interaction between syntactic structure and discourse structure, with reference to English and other languages. The course will begin with review of the basic syntax from Nature of Language (head/argument structure, constituency tests, complement/adjunct distinction) and will then develop this basic syntactic theory further, based on analysis of declarative sentences in English and one other language. We will then begin the analysis of manipulations of basic sentence structure such as fronting, left- and  right- dislocation, clefting and passivization, exploring in parallel the syntactic description of such structures and their semantic/pragmatic functions, using appropriate theoretical concepts.   The course will provide students with tools to reason about and represent syntactic structure, and to accurately characterize the discourse-related properties of different sentence types.

The mathematical solutions of these problems involve a rigorous concept of computability or calculability that turned out to be fundamental for computer science, but also cognitive science.   We first discuss predicate logic and systematic ways of constructing proofs; that is followed by the formal development of elementary set theory.  The concept of Turing machine computation is introduced and shown to be equivalent to the concept of recursive function. That provides the mathematical, methodologically adequate tools for establishing the results mentioned above.  The mathematical and computational notions and results are among the most significant contributions of logic, not just to the solution of internal logical questions and to the foundations of computer science, but also to (the beginnings of) a deeper understanding of the human mind and mental processes. In addition to the mathematical developments, we will discuss historical and philosophical aspects of the subject.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=15-251" title="15-251" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-251');">15-251</a> or <a href="/search/?P=21-300" title="21-300" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-300');">21-300</a> or <a href="/search/?P=80-210" title="80-210" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-210');">80-210</a> or <a href="/search/?P=80-211" title="80-211" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-211');">80-211</a> or <a href="/search/?P=80-310" title="80-310" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-310');">80-310</a></dd>

Those who live in extreme poverty frequently lack effective access to proper nutrition, adequate shelter, safe drinking water, and sanitation.  As a result, they also bear the greatest burdens of famine and epidemic disease and frequently face social and political conditions of unrest and systematic oppression.  This course examines the question of what, if anything, we in the technologically and economically developed world owe to the global poor.  It therefore focuses considerable attention on competing theories of global distributive justice and the relationship between poverty, poor health, and human rights.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Frank Ramsey played a crucial intellectual role in the Cambridge of Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein and Keynes (just to mention some central figures of the exceptionally lively and creative atmosphere of Cambridge at the beginning of the past century).  During his short life (he died in 1930 at the age of only 26) he made decisive contributions to epistemology, decision theory, philosophical and mathematical logic, philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics and philosophy of science.  Just to mention an example, his paper `Truth and Probability' laid the foundations of the modern theory of subjective probability and also those of modern utility theory and decision theory. The entire core of Ramsey's philosophical and scientific work consists of no more than 15 papers.  But in all cases they are remarkable essays that changed the intellectual topics they touched.  Moreover they all contain the same view of philosophy merging a sound portion of Moorean realism with Ramsey's kind of pragmatist philosophy.  The course reviews these central papers and its rich relations with the Cambridge philosophers of this time and the Vienna Circle.  In addition it is remarkable that most of Ramsey's views remain valid today almost a century after his death.  So, the course considers as well the impact of Ramsey's views in contemporary analytic philosophers and those influenced by early American pragmatism.

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-381 Meaning in Language</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course is an introduction to the study of meaning from a linguistic perspective. Linguists studying meaning need to be able to say what the meanings of sentences are, and to explain how those meanings are constructed from the meanings of sentence parts: words, morphemes and syntactic structure. In this course, we'll focus on developing a vocabulary for talking about the truth conditional content of sentences:  the part of meaning that has to do with representing the world as being a particular way. We'll also investigate how particular words and constructions affect the appropriateness conditions of sentences in which they occur, that is, the conditions under which those sentences can be appropriately used in discourse. As we'll see, many linguistic items affect sentence meaning in both of these ways simultaneously. The semantic contributions of a wide range of linguistic forms will be covered in the course. By the end of the semester, you will be able to state clearly what the difference is between the noun phrases "a dog"  and "the dog"; you'll understand the difference between the sentence "All dogs have tails" and the sentence "Dogs have tails"; and you'll know why the sentence "John left yesterday" sounds fine but the sentence "John has left yesterday" doesn't. You'll know how to talk about the meanings of sentences with modals, like "John might have left", and you'll understand what the difference is between saying "JOHN didn't see Bill" and saying "John didn't see BILL". All this, and more. While the course will develop precise ways of talking about meaning, it will not be particularly technical.

The exploration will be hands on, and we will learn how to measure voice onset time, analyze stop bursts and fricative noise and see how the voicing of a consonant affects the pitch of the following vowel, using Praat.   On the phonological side, we will consider various ways in which voicing contrasts and processes have been represented, including SPE-style binary features, feature geometry and Optimality Theory.  One of the central themes will be how to reconcile phonological accounts of voicing phenomena with our understanding of their underlying phonetic principles.  Both rule-based and constraint-based approaches to phonology rely on discrete symbols, whether they be phones or features, but the speech stream is not neatly divided into segment-sized units, and the features of phonological theory are typically spread over multiple segments.  Additionally, many phonological explanations recapitulate phonetic principles, calling into question what we consider to be an explanation of sound patterns.

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-383 Language in Use</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />We use language to communicate, to convey meaning. But not all of what we mean is contained ? encoded ? in the language that we use. Suppose you ask me, ?Is Jane coming to the party?? and I reply ?She has to finish her homework.? The pronoun ?she?  encodes the information that I am referring to some female individual; but does not encode the information that I intend to refer specifically to Jane. This, the addressee has to figure out given the use of the sentence in that particular context. Nor does the sentence encode the actual answer to the original question. It is clear in the context that the intended answer is ?no?; but again, this is something which the speaker relies on the hearer being able to figure out in the context of use. In other situations of use, an utterance of the same sentence would not convey that meaning. The investigation of inferences about speaker meaning that arise from the use of language in particular contexts is part of the field of linguistic pragmatics, which is the topic of this course. \tLinguistic pragmatics is also, though, concerned with some aspects of encoded meaning. In addition to the words and constructions which contribute ordinary truth-conditional content to the meaning of an utterance, there are words and constructions which serve as indicators of the function of a sentence, or of how it is intended to fit into a discourse, or of the assumptions that the speaker is making that motivate her utterance. To characterize the meanings or functions of such expressions, we need, again, to make reference to contexts and speakers: features of the uses of linguistic forms. \tThis course provides an introduction to the investigation of pragmatic features of language. We will aim to develop a ?toolkit? for pragmatic analysis to enable students to address questions about the pragmatic features of language and languages that they encounter.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=80-100" title="80-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-100');">80-100</a> or <a href="/search/?P=80-180" title="80-180" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-180');">80-180</a></dd>

We will consider the impact of diachronic factors on  the synchronic study of language, and we will also examine certain recent  techniques used to establish genetic relations between languages. To a  large extent the course will be student-driven, and it can be seen as an  extended case-study for applying concepts and analytical strategies taught  in Nature of Language, Phonetics and Phonology, Linguistic Analysis, and  other relevant courses.

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />This course is intended to provide an introduction to the methods of syntactic analysis, and to some major themes of contemporary syntactic theory, following up on syntactic concepts introduced in 80180, Nature of Language. A primary theme of the course is the structural constituency of a sentence, and the course will address some of the following questions. What are syntactic constituents? Do all aspects of syntax manipulate the same kinds of structural units, or do different grammatical processes rest on incompatible notions of constituency? How do other syntactic relations connect with constituent structure? To the extent that there is mismatch between different notions of syntactic structure, how can it be reconciled within a theory of grammar? These questions are engaged in through the diagnostics and techniques of modern syntactic analysis and argumentation. Those tools will allow us to explore the striking ways in which syntactic theory unifies diverse grammatical phenomena in terms of a common notion of phrase structure. The course complements 80280, Linguistic Analysis, building on but not presupposing syntactic analyses developed in that class.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />What do you get when you cross cutting edge interactive media technologies with inquiry into the big questions of human existence?  Let's find out!  New technologies-including online gaming, interactive film, "social" media, podcasts and smartphone apps-have enormous potential to change the way people learn.  Especially intriguing is their potential to promote active, exploratory learning.     We have only scratched the surface of this potential.  Imagine interactive technologies that impart a deep understanding of the human condition.  Imagine the compelling motivational strategies of well-designed games used to spark inquiry and scientific curiosity.  Imagine immersive experiences that deepen our capacity for critical thinking, empathy or compassion.  What if we applied absorbing interactive media to the task of delivering a first-rate humane education?   In this course, we will explore a topic of elemental human concern (e.g. inequality, abortion and human reproduction, the nature of the social contract, the separation of church and state, population and sustainability\205) and develop a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of the issue.  Then, instead of producing a term paper, we'll collaborate with a team from CMU's Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) to design and prototype a next-generation learning tool that brings the issue to life.  The result will push the boundaries of what is possible in the way of technologically mediated learning.<br />

This course will cover those parts of game theory of special interest to social scientists and philosophers. We will discuss specific elements of the formal theory, including: the distinction between cooperative and non-cooperative games, games in the strategic and the extensive form, solution concepts, epistemic conditions needed to predict outcomes of games, equilibrium refinements, dynamical models of equilibrium selection, and folk theorems of indefinitely repeated games. We will discuss results in experimental economics that test some of the assumptions of classical game theory.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Proof Theory is one of the core subjects of mathematical logic. It interacts with central issues in computer science, artificial intelligence as well as mathematics but also with broader methodological, philosophical questions.  This course presents a theory of formal proofs that serve to represent mathematical arguments.    \tWe first study proofs in natural deduction and sequent calculi. We show that every proof is reducible to a normal one; normal proofs have an important internal structure and are critical for automated theorem proving and proof search. They are also critical for metamathematical studies that concern, for example, consistency and decidability. \tWe then examine frameworks for the formalization of mathematical practice: starting with arithmetic and ending with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, after having made  a detour through Church's simple type theory.  As strict formalization is here not just a matter of principle but of real practice, we will discuss interactive theorem proving systems (AProS, Isabelle, Twelf) that can be used for the formal verification of mathematical proofs.  \tFinally, Gödel's second incompleteness theorem (of 1931) is the starting point for considering an extension of Hilbert's finitist consistency program. (We will establish Gödel's theorem for set theory and arithmetic.)  We present, as a paradigm of pre-Gödelian investigations, the consistency proof Hilbert & Bernays gave in 1922 for a quantifier-free part of arithmetic. Then we discuss the Gödel-Gentzen-reduction of classical to intuitionist arithmetic and present Gentzen's 1936 consistency proof of the latter by transfinite induction (up to epsilon-0). \tAt every stage of our investigations, we will pay particular attention to a more external, conceptual structure of proofs that facilitates interactive theorem proving and lays the basis for automated proof search as well.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=21-300" title="21-300" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-300');">21-300</a> or <a href="/search/?P=80-310" title="80-310" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-310');">80-310</a> or <a href="/search/?P=80-311" title="80-311" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-311');">80-311</a></dd>

Developed in the mid-20th century to attack geometrical problems, subsequent progress has revealed deep connections to algebra and logic, as well as to mathematical physics and computer science. The course emphasizes two perspectives. On one hand, we develop the basic theory of categories, regarded as mathematical structures in their own right. At the same time, we will consider the application of these results to concrete examples from logic and algebra.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Ethics & Medical Research:  This course covers foundational issues in the ethical evaluation and regulation of research involving human subjects. It begins with a historical overview of the origins of research ethics after World War II as a response to high profile cases of abuse or scandal. This unit covers "classic cases" including the Tuskegee syphilis study, the Willowbrook hepatitis study, the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital Case, and others. It also covers seminal documents such as the Nuremberg Code, the Belmont Report, and the current federal regulations known as the Common Rule. Against this historical backdrop, the course then examines foundational philosophical issues in human-subjects research including ethical issues in clinical trial design, the concept of equipoise and the use of placebo controls, the requirements of justice in the research context, and the values of privacy and informed consent.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-447 Global Justice</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Until recently, the dominant view of international relations among both academics and politicians was that governments and citizens of one country have no moral or legal obligations to anyone beyond their own borders.  The later half of the 20th century has seen a dramatic change in this attitude, with a much greater willingness to recognize that demands of justice may transcend national borders and bind different states and their people.  This course examines this shift through the lenses of history, philosophy, law, politics, and anthropology.  It is being offered in conjunction with the 2009-2010 Humanities Center Colloquium Series on ³Global Connections, Global Responsibilities.²  Topics covered include: theories of justice; sovereignty; the universality of human rights; global inequality and poverty; trade and labor in the global economy; climate change; humanitarian intervention and just war; post-conflict reconciliation and social reconstruction; as well as the emergence of transnational modes of governance.  In addition to several short writing assignments, students will have the opportunity to carry out a research project on a relevant topic of their choice.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Algebra and number theory in the nineteenth century Jeremy Avigad (Carnegie Mellon) and Ken Manders (University of Pittsburgh) (This seminar is listed jointly between the two universities).    A number of questions regarding the types of equations that can be solved in the integers and in the reals have their origins in antiquity, when mathematics was held to be the science of quantity, both continuous (magnitude) and discrete (number). The beginning of the nineteenth century brought striking advances along these lines. For example, Gauss gave a detailed analysis of the integers that can be represented by a given quadratic form, and Abel and Galois showed that the general quintic equation has no solution by radicals.    A good deal of effort in the nineteenth century was devoted to making sense of these results, and by the end of the century the ideas had been recast in algebraic structural terms. Galois theory and the study of quadratic forms are now invariably presented in terms of field extensions and their properties. This shift is prototypical of the transition to the "modern" view of mathematics.    In this seminar, we will trace the development of these ideas. We will focus, as much as possible, on the original sources, with an eye towards obtaining a better understanding of the methodological considerations that drove these developments.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course focuses on applications of category theory in logic and computer science. A leading idea is functorial semantics, according to which a model of a logical theory is a set-valued functor on a category determined by the theory. This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a theory and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, leading naturally to the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from classical semantics. Such categorical models occur, for example, in denotational semantics. e.g. treating the lambda-calculus via the theory of Cartesian closed categories. Similarly, higher-order logic is treated categorically by the theory of topoi. Note: this course will begin with a 3 week refresher of basic category theory - CS students can start after immigration by reviewing on their own.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=80-413" title="80-413" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-413');">80-413</a></dd>

We'll examine how his theory of estimation and how his approach to the design of experiments are linked through Fisher Information.  Also, we'll consider several attempts made after 1960 to extend Fisher's ideas, including efforts to make it more-Bayesian in some ways (relating to the techniques Fisher advocated in the Behrens-Fisher solution), and ideas to make it less Bayesian in other ways (relating to using interval probability, as in H.E.Kyburg's Epistemological Probability theory and in Dempster-Shafer theory).<br />

EGT relaxes the "high rationality" assumptions of traditional game theory in favor of conceptualizing individuals as subject to evolution by natural selection or some form of trial and error learning.  EGT provides a justification for many of the traditional concepts in game theory, but also highlights potential problems with this theory.    This course will provide an overview of evolutionary game theory, and then will investigate two applications of that theory.  The first application is the explanation of pro-social behaviors including cooperation, fairness, and altruism.  The second application is to the emergence of linguistic behaviors, especially in non-human animals.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=80-413" title="80-413" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '80-413');">80-413</a> or 80-713.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">80-580 Seminar on the Philosophy of Language</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Seminar on the Philosophy of Language: The Construction of Meaning.  The prevailing standard model of linguistic interpretation traces back to the work of Paul Grice. On Grice's model, the interpretation of a linguistic utterance is a two stage process. First, an interpreter calculates the meaning of the sentence uttered on the basis of the conventional meanings of the words and syntactic constructions used. The output of this compositional process is assumed to be a proposition. Then, the interpreter proceeds to make inferences, based on this proposition and other contextual information, as to what the speaker meant. Crucially, this process (a) treats the truth conditional content of sentences as compositionally determinable on the basis of purely linguistic information and (b) clearly separates the contribution of semantic processes and pragmatic (inferential) ones. This standard picture has been critiqued from a variety of perspectives, and there is an ongoing debate surrounding the theory of the construction of meaning. Some philosophers and linguists have argued that inferential processes indeed do contribute to the determination of truth conditional content, or "what is said." Others defend some version of the standard view, and have provided a variety of responses to critiques. Both kinds of view come in different degrees, ranging from extreme contextualists to those who deny that naive intuitions about utterance interpretation provide insight into the acutal meanings of sentences. In this seminar, we will read the literature in which this debate has been and is being carried out. Readings will primarily be drawn from the philosophical and linguistic literature, with some forays into psycholinguistics and computational linguistics.<br />

Students in the course will be exposed to several broad theoretical perspectives, each of which attempts to capture and understand the origins and consequences of individual distinctiveness from a slightly different vantage point. Included among these approaches are the dispositional, psychoanalytic, learning, phenomenological, and cognitive self regulation perspectives. This is a survey course and is intended to provide students with a broad background of theory and research in the area. Class meetings consist primarily of lecture, but there is some discussion too. In addition, classroom exercises will allow students to test their own personalities.<br />

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Much of the work in groups and organizations consists of communication. You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to coordinate activity, and to sell yourself and your work. The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking, and managing impressions. Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work. Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures. Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks. Cases and group projects give you an opportunity to apply what you've learned.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=36-201" title="36-201" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-201');">36-201</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-207" title="36-207" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-207');">36-207</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-217" title="36-217" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-217');">36-217</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-220" title="36-220" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-220');">36-220</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-225" title="36-225" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-225');">36-225</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-247" title="36-247" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-247');">36-247</a> or <a href="/search/?P=70-207" title="70-207" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '70-207');">70-207</a></dd>

The purpose of this class is to think deeply about how our theories  and research findings have been and could be applied to support and enhance  the development of children in a variety of contexts, such as at home,  daycare, school, playgrounds, etc. and to evaluate different activities,  materials and/or contexts in reference to various theories and empirical  findings.

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />Perception, broadly defined, is the construction of a representation of the external world for purposes of thinking and acting.  Although we often think of perception as the processing of inputs to the sense organs, the world conveyed by the senses is ambiguous, and cognitive and sensory systems interact to interpret it.  In this course, we will examine the sensory-level mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch.  We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development. We will look at methods of psychophysics, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology.  The goals include not only imparting basic knowledge about perception but also providing new insights into everyday experiences.<br />

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />The famous psychologist George Miller once said that Psychology should "give itself away."  The goal of this course is to look at cases where we have done so -- or at least tried.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se.  That impact can take the form of a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute. The application should have a theoretical base, as contrasted, say, with pure measurement research as in ergonomics. Examples of applications are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors based on models of cognitive processing, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measurses of consumers' implicit attitudes.    The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?  The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">85-443 Social Factors and Well-Being</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course will focus on the role that our social environment plays in our  feelings of well-being and in the maintenance of our mental and physical  health.  Topics to be discussed include marriage, widowhood, loneliness,  social support, social participation, social aspects of personality (e.g.,  social anxiety, extraversion, agreeableness, and hostility), social  stressors (betrayal and conflict), discrimination, and socioeconomic status.  We will consider how each social factor develops, the extent to which we can  alter it or its effects on our lives, and how it influences our overall  well-being.  Instructor permission is required.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">85-444 Relationships</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The primary goal of this course is to introduce you to social psychological theory and research on the topic of relationships.  Although a variety of relationship phenomena will be discussed, a heavy emphasis will be placed on research that addresses fundamental processes in close relationships.  The coverage of material will include a review of historical roots and classic approaches to the scientific study of relationships, as well as exciting new research and theory on particular subtopics.  The majority of class time is spent discussing and evaluating recent research. Special emphasis also is given to learning and critically evaluating the methodological tools that are used to study close relationships.  The goal is for students to leave this course with a broad overview of the field and an in-depth understanding of particular subtopics.      This is an advanced seminar in which students will be expected to read original research articles and chapters on assigned topics and come to class prepared to discuss the material.  Readings will consist of theoretical and empirical articles from psychology journals and related sources.  Additional course requirements will involve short, weekly writing assignments, student presentations of research articles, and a written research proposal.  Over the course of the semester, students will design and carry out a small-scale, original investigation on a relationships topic of interest.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=85-340" title="85-340" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '85-340');">85-340</a></dd>

Each student will individually schedule a consistent 6 hours per week helping in a Children's School classroom (preferably 2 or 3 chunks of time).  Classroom duties will include working one-on-one and with small groups of students as they do puzzles, art projects, dramatic play, etc., as well as helping with snack, playground supervision, classroom cleanup, and storytime.  Each student will be expected to keep a journal 1) relating general experiences to developmental theories and 2) documenting the development of a particular child during the semester.  All students will meet for a 1 hour weekly discussion with the director. Discussion topics and related readings will be selected collaboratively, based on issues/questions raised by the group's observations and discussions.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=85-221" title="85-221" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '85-221');">85-221</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-104 Decision Processes in American Political Institutions</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />This is an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of politics and government, drawing mostly on political science, but also on economics. It familiarizes the student with the basic structures and processes of American government. The main theoretical tools are spatial models of political decision making, and models of collective action problems. The course focuses on politics and government in the United States, but explicit comparisons are made with politics in other countries. Grading is usually based on two midterm exams and a final exam, as well as a short writing assignment, several quizzes and homework.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-110 Experiments with Economic Principles</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />This course is designed to teach the basic principles of economics through   the use of experiments. In each experiment you will be an   active participant attempting to make deals with other traders in the   market. At the end of the experiment it is time to really put economics to   the test---can economic theory really explain the complex interactions of the   participants in your experiment? One nice feature of these experiments is   that you can be both a participant and an observer, and you often will   learn nearly as much about economic principles from your experience as a   participant as you will from the analysis of the experiment as an observer.   Topics covered include basic market behavior, auctions, rent control,  pollution, network externalities, information economics, and   international trade.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-111 SDS Freshman Seminar: Human Rights and Global Politics</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The purpose of the seminar is to study human rights from different dimensions. First, we will examine the meaning of the term and the issues associated with defining the human rights field. What are these rights? What is their origin? Secondly, we will examine which rights/issues have been raised in the contemporary international political system and the responses from major international actors such as the United States, the Western European countries, International Organizations, and the NGO's such as Amnesty International. The central issue here is one of answers and policies toward human rights abuses/issues. Finally, we will analyze a number of case studies. Some case studies will be presented in the lectures, some will be discussed by the students. Students will be asked to do research and report on a case of human rights abuses looking not only at the issue or conflict that has led to those abuses, but also international responses to the issue.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">88-114 SDS Freshman Seminar: Everyday Irrationality</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This seminar will cover the historical progression from belief in hot irrationality--i.e., emotional interference with an otherwise pristine intellect (Plato, Freud) through cold irrationality--i.e., clear thought stymied by common cognitive biases and heuristics (Tversky and Kahneman)--through a possible  integration of hot and cold approaches--e.g. resulting from attentional mechanisms (Simon, Loewenstein, Lerner). Then the professor and students will discuss belief in ESP, alternative medicines, faith healing and Nazism in terms of the principles proposed. During the last half of the semester, students will choose a particular irrational belief to study and will both present to other students and write a term paper describing its acceptance (by at least some people) and possible reasons for such acceptance. The major text will be Dawes's new book "Everyday Irrationality: How Pseudo-Scientists, Lunatics, and the Rest of Us Systematically Fail to Think Rationally." This book will be supplemented by selected readings from Plato, Freud, Hines's book on "Pseudoscience and the Paranormal," Gilovish's book of "How We Know What Isn't So," a book of first-hand accounts by the perpetrators of the Holocaust entitled "Death Dealers," and finally Browning's book of "Ordinary Men.".<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-115 Risk Communications for Health Decisions</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This seminar will explore how people make decisions about risk behaviors in various contexts relating to their health, including diet and exercise, sexual behavior, smoking, drinking, drug use, etc. The main focus of the course will be looking at efforts to improve health by educating people to make better decisions about reducing their own health risks. Students will participate in active class discussion, debating the benefits of different approaches to public health. The mid-term project will include basic research and data collection on a health behavior. The final project will include the production and planned evaluation of a public service announcement, aimed at improving health decisions and behaviors. Readings will include book chapters and original research articles relating to the psychology behind such behaviors and trade-offs.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">88-116 HSS Freshman Seminar: Psychobabble</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />At the beginning of the semester we will go through my annotated dictionary of psychobabble and show videos of psychobabble in "living action"-e.g. recovering repressed memories of being raised in a satanic cult, believing it is possible to communicate with autistic children through "facilitated communication" where they indicate to a skilled typist/therapist what they want to spell out on a keyboard (without looking). Then I will have students volunteer to lead discussions about particular types of psychobabble. Attendance will be required. Evaluation will be on the basis of presentations and a term paper.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">88-117 Social Dilemmas from Overpopulation to Global Warming</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Social dilemmas are situations in which a number of people make simultaneous choices between what is roughly termed "cooperative" versus "non-cooperative" behavior where the individual payoffs for the non-cooperative choice are always higher than for the non-cooperative choice   no matter what other people involved in the decision do. Yet universal cooperation is preferred to universal non-cooperation by all the people making choices.      The first part of the seminar will be devoted to reading the classic theoretical arguments about social dilemmas, and to the surveying some of the empirical findings of social psychologists such as Dawes about what variables other than payoff changes might enhance the probability of cooperative choices, e.g., "identification with the group".      After becoming familiar with the theoretical and empirical literature, the members of the seminar will be asked to give presentations concerning either their own ideas or the ideas of some other theorist or investigator about how to enhance the incidence of cooperative choice.     Each member of the seminar will be expected to lead one session presenting such ideas and to write a term paper about them.<br />
</dd>
</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">88-119 Strategy Cooperation and Competition</dt>
<dd>9 units<br />When should a person cooperate and when should a person be selfish in an ongoing social interaction?  How can a business establish strategic partnerships when it comes to creating a pie and at the same time battle with competitors when it comes to dividing up the pie?  Strategic thinking requires a framework to think through the implications of cooperation and of competition.  Game theory is a systematic approach to understanding how people, firms, or countries interact with one another to achieve their own goals.  In this course students will learn to apply game theory to analyze strategic situations arising in the business world as well as in politics, sports, and international relations.  We will discuss how individuals and businesses can shape the games they play to their benefit and how social policies can be implemented to encourage cooperation benefiting everybody.  Readings will focus on real-life stories accompanied by a full analysis of the principles involved.  Students will give presentations applying these principles to a strategic problem they find engaging. Students will also be placed in the role of strategist in simulations in class.<br />

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This course will introduce students to major concepts and theories in the social and decision sciences, focusing in particular on  how cognition and emotion shape judgment and choice. We will address such questions as: In what ways do emotions influence judgments and choices? What are some common mistakes in judgment and decision making? Can information shape our choices even if we do not consciously recognize the information? Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding: (1) basic theories and research findings of decision science and psychology, and (2) the relevance of research findings to everyday life.<br />

<dd>Fall and Spring<br />This course is part of a set of 100-level courses offered by H&SS departments as independent studies for second-semester freshmen, and first- or second-semester sophomores, in the College. In general, these courses are designed to give students some real research experience through work on a faculty project or lab in ways that might stimulate and nurture subsequent interest in research participation. Faculty and students devise a personal and regular-ized meeting and task schedule. Each Research Training course is worth 9 units, which generally means a minimum for students of about 9 work-hours per week. These courses are offered only as electives; i.e., they cannot be applied toward a college or major requirement, although the units do count toward graduation as elective units. Additional details (including a roster and descriptions of Research Training Courses available in any given semester) are available in the H&SS Academic Advisory Center. Prerequisites/ restrictions: for H&SS students only; only for second-semester freshmen, or first- or second-semester sophomores; minimum cumulative QPA of 3.0 (at the time of registration) required for approved entry; additional prerequisites (e.g., language proficiency) may arise out of the particular demands of the research project in question.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-205 Comparative Politics</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />The goal of this course is to use the comparative method to learn about the evolution of political ideas and political systems in selected countries. The course is centered on the study of political ideologies, political systems, institutions, and policies. The course will focus on four countries: China, Cuba, Iran and South Africa and the political philosophy that inspired those regimes structures, foundations, and policies.    Each of the case studies will allow the students to learn about the ideology, political institutions, and policies, as well as the political and economic transformation of those countries or regions.     Students will be expected to compare political ideologies, political institutions, socioeconomic policies and the consequences that those policies have on the society.    The course provides the student with both knowledge about critical political ideas and systems and the skills required to analyze and formulate policies.<br />

When do political protests lead to regime change?  What types of political systems produce the "best" outcomes?  In this class students will learn the art and science of comparative politics.  We will ask central questions to understanding how political systems emerge, how they change, and how they survive.  To do so, students will learn core theories of comparative politics and be introduced to the major methods of inquiry designed to test those theories.  Students will learn to evaluate current events through a comparative politics lens and draw reasoned conclusions by considering contemporary issues in light of the theories covered.  Students should be prepared to think critically, analyze complex arguments and data, and apply theories to the "real world."  Upon completing the course, students will be well-equipped for advanced study of comparative politics, and will also be able to think like a comparative political scientists as they interpret events in the world around them.<br />

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />This course provides an introduction to theories and methods for policy analysis. The main focus of the course is to develop an understanding of how theories from social science, such as economics, can help us understand policy issues such as allocation, regulation, and welfare. Throughout the course we analyze outcomes produced by private markets, by examining consumer choice, the supply and demand of factors and produced goods, and general and partial equilibrium. We also analyze the efficiency and welfare properties of such outcomes, paying special attention to the role of policy in influencing market outcomes. We consider how policy can address the efficiency and welfare shortcomings of markets that may result from informational asymmetries, industrial organization, moral hazard, transactions costs, and bounded rationality. Markets are compared in this light with organizational, governmental, and other modes of resource allocation. Grading will be based mainly on 3 exams. Homework assignments and/or quizzes will comprise a smaller part of the grade. Priority access is given to SDS junior and senior students.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-252 Causal Inference in the Field: Using Data to Study Crime, Love, Sports &amp; More</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Causal questions are pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences, and empirical researchers often use regression analysis as a tool for tackling such questions.  This course focuses on the scientific problem of analyzing causal hypotheses in real-world settings, not on the mathematical details of regression.  After clearly distinguishing prediction from causation, we discuss how to represent causal hypotheses and how to use regressions to analyze both predictive and causal hypotheses.     Using in-class data exercises throughout, we will examine how to move from an interesting but somewhat vague question about the world (e.g., do police discriminate based on race and gender, do NFL athletes choke under high pressure, does parenthood improve happiness) to a clear statistical model that, when estimated, meaningfully addresses the question asked.  The course emphasizes causal analysis as the main research goal and multivariate linear regression as the main statistical tool.  After mastering basic techniques, we will introduce students to more advanced econometric approaches such as panel regressions and instrumental variables to deal with trickier settings in which causal inference is more challenging (e.g., do more guns lead to more violence?).    In keeping with the hands-on philosophy of the course, a central focus of the semester will be a group research paper/presentation where students will have the opportunity to formulate and empirically test a research question of their choosing.  Students will learn how to find, clean, and analyze a new dataset, and then concisely communicate their findings in the form of a scientific paper (and accompanying presentation).

A second set of issues concerns how various organizational forms motivate, or fail to motivate, employees.

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />In their firm desire to perfect the new Constitution, which defined and limited the powers and roles of their new government, the founding fathers insisted on explicit statements that would protect the rights of the new nation's citizens.   Indeed, the protection of these essential rights in many ways drove and defined their successful rebellion from Britain.  This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights.   The very first (and arguably considered at the time as the most essential) of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the "free speech" amendment to the Constitution.  This amendment guarantees every U.S. citizen five freedoms: freedom of religion, speech, press, peaceable assembly, and the freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances.  This course examines the historical and philosophical roots of this key constitutional amendment, how it has been fleshed out and defined over time through case law, and the bases of some more recent critics of this amendments and current interpretations.<br />

It has applications that range from managing potentially hazardous technologies, to involving patients more fully in the choice of medical procedures, to the design of computer-interactive systems.  The course covers behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision making.  Topics include heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, strategies for combining information from different sources and dealing with conflicting objectives, and the roles of group and emotional processes in decision making.

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />This course is a survey of research and insight into one of the most unique American government institutions: the judiciary.  Rather than exclusively reading case law (as one would do in a Constitutional Law class), this course examines court structure, rules of law and, most importantly, judges as actors within an institutional setting.  We will focus on how rules, norms, and expectations guide the decisions, actions, and range of options available to judges.  Here we will study the nature of judicial decision-making and its antecedents, the organization of the judicial branch and its implications for behavior, and the strategic interactions both within courts and between the courts and the more "political" branches of government.   The course will look at state and federal courts within the United States, supplemented with examples from international jurisdictions.  Material from law, history, economics, political science, sociology, and psychology will be introduced throughout the semester.

We will explore issues in both international security and cooperation.  Specific topics include war, regime promotion, foreign aid, trade, and international treaties/organization. Rather than looking at international system at a macro level, this course aims to investigate the causes and consequences of foreign policies that have roots in domestic political institutions. For example, how does domestic politics constrain or encourage leaders to go to war, sign a trade pact, and send foreign aid? How can citizens incentivize policymakers to achieve desirable foreign policy goals? How do international affairs such as trade, foreign aid, and promotion of democracy affect our lives in a long-run?

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-336 Autocrats and Democrats</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The international system is populated by countries with many different types of national governments.  A common simplification of the many diverse political systems in the world is to divide them between democratic states and non-democratic states.  Non-democratic states are also often further simplified as just "autocracies."  This simplification misses many key institutional differences between democracies and autocracies.  Furthermore, and even more dangerously, it causes us to overlook key similarities between these two regime types.  In this course we have three aims.  First, we unpack what is meant by autocracies: What are the different types of non-democratic regimes out there?  Second, we evaluate the strategic incentives faced by all types of autocratic leaders and democratic leaders.  Finally, we ask what these differences mean for international relations, for democracy-building, and for the future of the organization of national governments.  If some of the roots of conflict come from misunderstandings between autocracies and democracies, perhaps a better understanding will contribute to heightened international cooperation, not conflict.    An additional goal throughout the course is to build student familiarity with the different types of autocracies out there: We often think of them as dangerous, as unfriendly, or as deeply foreign, simply because we do not understand them or know much about them.  Through this exploration, students will be asked to re-consider much of what they've thought about both democracies and non-democracies.  Class assignments will ask students to critically examine existing theories of political organization and apply their knowledge to real world cases, both historical and contemporary.<br />

The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them.  To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong.  The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations.  This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking and managing impressions.  Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work.

Policy relevant examples will be used throughout the course.    When thinking about protecting nature environmental economics has traditionally focused on the idea that market failure (externalities, non rival goods, asymmetric information) is the critical source of economic inefficiency. Based on this idea economists have designed policies for environmental protection, which include Pigouvian taxes, marketable permits, liability rules and mechanisms design.    We will start from the theories of externalities, market failure and mechanism design, and we shall explore the causes of these problems and some of the potential remedies using the competing/complementary lenses of traditional and behavioral economics.    To organise and evaluate alternative environmental policy options environmental economics has traditionally used rational choice theory.    According to rational choice theory, people respond to policy instruments in their own self-interests and take all possible consequences into account. Behavioral economics has emerged to challenge this traditional view by documenting how people make choices and state values that deviate from the conventional rationality model. We will try to understand the behavioral economics underpinnings of environmental policy and how understanding the success and failure of conventional economic theory can help make good environmental policy better.<br />Prerequisites: 73-150 or <a href="/search/?P=88-220" title="88-220" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '88-220');">88-220</a></dd>

This discussion-based seminar surveys the emerging field of social cognitive neuroscience and its multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context. We will review current theories and methods guiding the field and recent research examining the neural bases of social processes, including: theory of mind, empathy, emotion, morality, among others. We will also discuss broader questions that apply to the specific topics that the course covers, including: What are appropriate levels of description for the target phenomena? How can different disciplines in neuroscience and the social sciences contribute to social neuroscience research? What can we learn from animals? behavior about human social cognition?

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Behavioral Economics is a sub-field of economics that, relying on insights from psychology and decision-making, aspires to describe actual behavior with greater empirical accuracy and psychological realism than that implied by the standard neoclassical model.  In this course, we will investigate the success of this approach in explaining ostensible anomalies in the "wild" such as under-savings for retirement, over-consumption of unhealthy food, extreme aversion to losses among investors, workers, and home-owners, the over-confidence of corporate CEOs and NFL general managers, and the influence of emotions on domestic violence, stock market activity, and risk-taking.   We will first document and review the underlying theory for three conceptual departures from the standard model -non-standard preferences (e.g., present-bias, reference dependence), non-standard beliefs (e.g., overconfidence, gambler''s fallacy), and non-standard decision-making (e.g., heuristics, emotions, framing effects)-and then quickly move to assess the evidence for these claims in field settings.   We will additionally explore how markets respond to behavioral biases, and discuss recent research in behavioral policy with an emphasis on policies aimed at increasing savings, improving food choice, and heightening program take-up and compliance.  The course will be paper-centric and we will review a variety of popular empirical methods from field experiments to quasi-experimental approaches (e.g., estimation through regression-based panel analyses, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables).

Certainly, opportunities for innovative activities take place in the context of the extant public policy institutions (e.g., entry restrictions in telecommunications, environmental performance standards, intellectual property protections). Consequently, entrepreneurial activity plays a key role in identifying and exploiting these opportunities. In this course, we examine the role that entrepreneurs play in the interrelationships between regulation and technological change.     The objectives are to develop and articulate an understanding of the theory, nature, and role of entrepreneurship in the American economy; the theory, nature, and role of regulation in the American economy; and the theory, nature, and role of the dynamic interaction of entrepreneurship and regulation in the American economy.  Students will evaluate historical cases in which new or changing regulation presents opportunity for entrepreneurial entry in business, as well as historical cases in which entrepreneur activity (in the form of innovation) presents new needs or opportunities for regulation, thereby presenting-or constraining-further opportunities for entry.

Here, we draw primarily from research in comparative politics & IR, but we also cover information science & systems thinking about the spread of ideas.  Finally, we consider the effect of attitudes on conflict by examining theories of IR & conflict at multiple levels of analysis: from intra-group conflict, to the relationship between domestic politics & IR, to the "first image" in IR, and to theories of cooperation under anarchy.  Throughout, the diverse collection of social science theories will be both illustrated by & critically evaluated through the consideration of contemporary and historical issues, including the rise of China, energy security, human security, & inter-ethnic conflict.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />For most of the past quarter century, no region of the world has been more economically dynamic than Asia.  This course is designed to provide students with the essential knowledge necessary to evaluate opportunities and risks in Asia.  The course will use analytical tools drawn from economics and finance, business cases, and guest lectures to focus on the key strengths that sustained economic growth in East Asia for decades, the weaknesses that undermined that growth in the late 1990s, and what lies ahead.  The course will also examine Indian economic growth since the early 1980s, and compare India's experience with that of the East Asian economies.  A special focus will be placed on recent developments in India and China and the prospects for continued growth in those countries over the next decade.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=73-100" title="73-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-100');">73-100</a> or 73-150 or <a href="/search/?P=88-220" title="88-220" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '88-220');">88-220</a></dd>

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />The scientific community has concluded that human industrial activities are causing global temperatures to increase.  Coping with the environmental, economic, and political consequences of this change is considered by many to be the preeminent public policy challenge of the 21st century. In this course, we will investigate the basic science of climate change, the prospective economic impact of global warming, the uncertainty involved in long-run climate forecasting, and the technological alternatives available to us as we seek to mitigate the impact of human industrial activity on global warming.  The heart of this course will be an in-depth analysis of the policy options available to the United States and the global community.  We will investigate the economic costs of these options and the way political realities are likely to shape and constrain policy at the national and international levels.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=73-100" title="73-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-100');">73-100</a> or 73-150 or <a href="/search/?P=88-220" title="88-220" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '88-220');">88-220</a></dd>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />This course provides CMU students with a historically grounded, technically informed, and policy-centered examination of energy and climate in the United States from the American Revolution to the nation's tri-centennial, by which time the nation will either have taken the necessary action to avoid massive catastrophes related to global warming or will be destined for-and perhaps already experiencing--a series of vastly catastrophic climate events that visit apocalyptic-like suffering and misery on large segments of the nation.  Energy procurement and expenditure in the US and climate change have been surprisingly linked over the nation's entire.  Now is the time for CMU students to understand these relationships historically, technically and scientifically, and politically and geopolitically.  The course is structured around the reading and discussion of landmark scholarship on energy and climate sewn together by lectures, films, and various unorthodox pedagogical methods.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-414 International and Subnational Security</dt>
<dd>9 units<br />The course explores various international and domestic security challenges that contemporary states face. Specifically, the course will survey the most recent research in political science that addresses the questions of why states choose to enter violent conflicts as opposed to settling disputes peacefully, how states may improve their security in the international arena, and how states may improve their security in the domestic environment. We will focus in depth on the bargaining explanations for war, democratic/regime similarity/capitalist peace, deterrence, interdependence, insurgency, and terrorism.  The course draws heavily upon research that employs game theoretic and computational models to develop logical arguments about political events and statistical analysis to test whether empirical reality follows the outlined theoretical predictions. The course will provide solid training in graphical literacy. Students will evaluate table-form output from statistical analysis, interpret graphical output, and receive a notion of game theoretic and computational models.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-415 Global Competitiveness: Firms Nations, and Technological Change</dt>
<dd>9 units<br />This course introduces students to the fundamental principles surrounding global competitiveness and technological change in the 21st century. The past twenty years have seen dramatic changes in innovation ecosystems in the U.S. and internationally. Alone within the U.S., there has been a sharp decline in corporate R&D labs, matched by the global fragmentation of firm activities. At the same time growing linkages have been observed across institutional   firms, government labs, and universities   and national borders. These changes raise critical questions about the new rules of the game driving technological change in the 21st century. This course sheds insights into these questions through the lenses of competing economic, sociological, and political science theories on the structures supporting technological change. The course is broken into three sections. The first section introduces students to theories of the firm, bureaucracy, institutional economics, and social networks as competing frameworks within which to understand technological change. The second section presents the contemporary literature on the technological change, including creative destruction, dominate designs, industry life cycles, and networks of innovators. The concluding section leverages lessons from the preceding two sections to evaluate national innovation systems, and the factors that lead to national comparative advantage. Students should leave the class able to reflect competently on what the existing literature tells us about the factors influencing global technology competitiveness, and on how modern changes in the structures supporting innovation as well as technology itself may be changing the rules of the game for firms and for nations. The course is open to seniors; also to juniors with instructor permission.<br />

In particular, the course will focus on the Democratic Peace and why democracies tend to win the wars they enter. We will discuss a variety of explanations for the Democratic Peace, that is, the tendency of democratic states to avoid war with each other. We will also discuss whether democratic states select wars more carefully, the incentives of democratic leaders when engaging in war, and whether domestic democratic structures provide states with war-fighting advantages with respect to military organization and soldier initiative.<br />

Decision makers use negotiation in a variety of circumstances   to reach agreements among countries, among employers and employees, among firms, and among family and friends.    There are two different sections of this course (students are not permitted to take both):    Domestic section: The objective of this course is to understand the process of negotiations and how the structure of the negotiation environment affects the outcomes achieved. Students will learn to analyze the features of the negotiation environment, develop an understanding of effective negotiation strategies, and identify the barriers to reaching wise agreements.  This course will focus on negotiations in a wide variety of context: public policy negotiations, business negotiations, and inter-personal negotiations.    International section:  The objective of this course is to understand the process of negotiations and how the structure of the negotiation environment affects the outcomes achieved. Students will learn to analyze the features of the negotiation environment, develop an understanding of effective negotiation strategies, and identify the barriers to reaching wise agreements.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />Institutional environment and public policy greatly affect incentives determining the direction of entrepreneurial activity and innovation that are the engines of economic growth. In societies with poor institutions, entrepreneurial talent is mostly directed towards seeking rents rather than generating productive innovations. But even in modern capitalist economies entrepreneurial activity and innovation are strongly influenced by public policies, for example, those related to intellectual property rights. This course seeks to provide students with analytical frameworks that will enable them to understand how various formal and informal institutional arrangements and public policy decisions influence entrepreneurial activity and innovation and how this, in its turn, affects economic efficiency and growth potential of nations.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">88-432 International Policy Decision Modeling Workshop</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Creating and "exercising" mathematical analysis in ways that inform policy and decision making is an art. One can acquire some relevant skills by taking "methods" classes or by reading and discussing case studies describing others' models, but true mastery comes only with practice, notably practice starting with a blank sheet of paper and creating one's own analysis from scratch. This course offers students the chance to practice that art in a "high-feedback" environment.  The primary goal is to improve modeling judgment (e.g., good sense about what should be included or excluded from a model or analysis), creativity (practice creating models from whole cloth), and strategy (weaving analytical insights into a coherent decision-relevant "story"). Students will also be taught some basic analytical frameworks and techniques applied to real world policy analysis problems in the international trade and investment policy domain.  Using these skills, students will undertake policy analysis projects for U.S. federal government trade policy agencies, potentially including the United States Trade Representative.    The instructor, Lee Branstetter, will draw upon his own policy experience in teaching the course and leading student policy analysis.  From August 2011-July 2012, Professor Branstetter served as the Senior Economist for International Trade and Investment Issues on President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.<br />

This course will highlight biases and heuristics in an intergroup rather than individual context, and in times of uncertainty or insecurity (e.g. conflict) rather than times of stability. Themes to be covered include: intergroup identities,perceptions, emotions, attributions, empathy, moral judgments, sacred values and parochial altruism. The course will draw on a variety of scientific methods (e.g. field & lab experiments, fMRI, and psychophysiology) and disciplinary approaches (e.g. decision science, anthropology, social/cognitive/cultural psychology, and political science).

Unintended side effects sometimes occur resulting in costs exceeding estimates and/or benefits never being realized.  This course will review the basics of regulatory policy and using historical examples, will explore the reasons why past regulations have succeeded and failed.  The second half of the course will involve 2-3 detailed case studies.  Quantitative methods will be used to evaluate several pending regulations for real-world clients from both government and industry perspectives.<br />

We will explore real data sets, examine various models for the data, assess the validity of their assumptions, and determine which conclusions we can make (if any). Data analysis is a bit of an art; there may be several valid approaches. We will strongly emphasize the importance of critical thinking about the data and the question of interest. Our overall goal is to use a basic set of modeling tools to explore and analyze data and to present the results in a scientific report. A minimum grade of C in any one of the pre-requisites is required.

<dt class="keepwithnext">36-492 Topic Detection and Document Clustering</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 6 units<br />Imagine if someone read all your email.  Everything you sent, everything you received.  What would they find? Do you have repeating topics?  How do the topics change over time?  The Enron Corporation was an energy, commodities, and services company in Houston, Texas that went spectacularly bankrupt in 2001 after it was revealed that it was engaging in systematic, planned accounting fraud.   At its peak, it employed over 20,000 people with revenues over $100 billion.  Its downfall was related to deregulation of California's energy commodity trading and a series of rolling power blackouts over months.  For example, Enron traders encouraged the removal of power during the energy crisis by suggesting plant shutdowns.  The resulting increase in the price for power made them a fortune.  After Enron's collapse, journalists used the Freedom of Information Act to release the emails sent/received by the employees of Enron.  Subsequently, the emails were analyzed to see who knew what and when.  Every news article, email, letter, blog, tweet, etc can be thought of as an observation.  We characterize these documents by their length, what words they use and how often, and possibly extra information like the time, the recipient, etc.  Topic detection and document clustering methods are statistical and machine learning tools that extract and identify related documents, possibly over time.  These methods need to be flexible enough to handle both very small and very large clusters of documents, topics that change in importance, and topics that appear and disappear.  This class will emphasize application of methods and real-world data analysis.  Class time will be split into lecture and "lab".  (Bring your laptop.)  Occasional homeworks and final project, but mostly we'll focus on the downfall of Enron as our overarching case study.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=36-401" title="36-401" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-401');">36-401</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-321 CMUWSP Internship Seminar</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 15 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. The internship is the experiential "core" of the Washington Semester program.  Students intern three days a week in offices from Capitol Hill to the White House including opportunities in cabinet agencies, nonprofit institutions, museums, advocacy groups, cultural institutions, and news organizations.  Through the internship, students gain professional experience and make long-lasting professional and personal contacts. In addition, students meet once a week with the CMU internship faculty - sometimes as a group and sometimes one-on-one -- to report and reflect on their internship experiences.   The internship and weekly internship meeting require approximately 27-28 hours per week. Students earn 15 CMU units of credit for the internship and internship seminar.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-323 Core Seminar: Congress</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. This thematic research seminar will explore the workings of Congress - the first branch under the Constitution - and its role in making public policy.  It combines coursework with the original scholarship requirements of a UCDC research seminar and is designed particularly for students in Congressional internships and those considering Congressional staff positions after graduation. This seminar will take advantage of our Washington location by featuring frequent guest speakers and seeking connections to current policy and political debate.  In addition to studying the pathways of lawmaking, we will ask how Congress and its Members relate to the other branches of government, the press, and the public.  Topics to be examined include the rules and organization of Capitol Hill, campaign finance, redistricting, lawmaking and the House and Senate rules, budget process and politics, executive oversight, judicial nominations, lobbyists and influence, and policy entrepreneurialism.  Seminar requirements in addition to the internship include preparation and in-class participation, a substantial research brief and several applied writing assignments related to a policy that currently is or should be before Congress.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-324 Core Seminar: Washington Media</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. This seminar will explore the rapidly changing relationship between the news media, political communication and governing. Washington offers the perfect backdrop with the opportunity to visit iconic institutions, such as the White House Press Room, Washington Post and Newseum, as well as the chance to witness up close the work of journalists, politicians and other political communicators at the top of their profession. Students will keep abreast of current political news in addition to readings on the practice and history of political journalism, communication and propaganda. Each student will complete an original research project, some of which may be adapted for publication in a California news outlet. The course is designed particularly, though not exclusively, for students interning at news organizations, political press offices, speechwriting groups, public relations firms or those with a passion for writing or politics. The instructor is veteran journalist Marc Sandalow, former Washington Bureau Chief for the San Francisco Chronicle, political analyst, and the author of a biography on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-325 Core Seminar: General Research</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. In this seminar each student will research, write, and present the findings of a major, original research paper. The paper (approximately 25 pages) should build on your major field of study and related in some way to your internship experience. The class will help guide you through the many stages of a research project: 1) selecting a meaningful question or problem that you wish to investigate; 2) reviewing existing scholarly writing on the topic in order to better articulate why your contribution is fresh and significant; 3) organizing and revising drafts of your paper; 4) designing and effectively delivering an oral presentation of your findings. As we help each other negotiate these steps, we will also consider issues related to what constitutes ?expertise? and why researchers may present competing evidence and conclusions. The class may include some guest speakers from and visits to some of the many research institutes in Washington.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-326 Core Seminar: The Presidency and Executive Branch</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. The White House, located in the heart of downtown Washington and just a ten minute walk from UCDC, is an international symbol that simultaneously highlights the lofty promise of American democracy and reflects the significant flaws in the American experiment. The research seminar will examine the strengths and drawbacks of presidential leadership, the evolving role of the presidency in American culture, and introduce students to some major thematic debates that define presidential politics. The seminar will draw on the city of Washington as an experience through visits to current and former White House aides, news correspondents, and political and policy experts. Seminar topics include how presidents have sought to enact their reform agendas from the New Deal to Reagan's economic program to President Obama's health reform law; how they have struggled to manage foreign affairs while leading the U.S. in wartime; why Congress, the Supreme Court, and the news media thwart and assist presidential agendas at different moments; how presidents have harnessed the "bully pulpit" in the modern age to rally voters to their ideas, push their policies, and position themselves for re-election; and how they have pursued strategies to manipulate a highly volatile, increasingly hostile Washington media climate.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-327 Core Seminar:International Policy and The Global System of the 21st Century</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. This course's first objective is to provide academic background and guidance to students whose internships involve international policy, international organizations, globalization, and international relations in general. Its second objective is to introduce participants to the latest literature and current debates on international and global change. What are the major actors in the international political arena of the 21st century? What are the characteristics of governmental, non-governmental, and intergovernmental actors engaged in international policy making? Can we somewhat appraise the type of international system that we will live under during the next decades? Will the United States continue to be a major global power? In order to take advantage of our location in Washington, I will bring in practitioners from different policy communities to speak to us about their work. I will also invite some journalists and academics.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-328 Elective Seminar: Lobbying, Money and Influence in Washington</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. This course will be an intense examination of lobbying in Washington with particular attention given to the role of money and campaign finance in the operation of what has become a highly sophisticated and poorly under-stood network of advocacy and influence. It will provide a basic understanding of three different but interrelated knowledge sets: the Congress, political money and lobbying by interest groups. Student should understand that while the lectures are focused on those individual subject areas and that the semester is divided into three separate sections for that purpose, the readings later in the term will often relate to earlier lectures. This is done with the intent of "connecting the dots" among all these somewhat diverse topical areas.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. How do we create a more sustainable world?  What is the role of energy and environmental policy?  Will technical innovation lead to better solutions?  What is the role of the consumer?  Should business climate change planning be under government mandate or voluntary?  Will market-based solutions work?  What metrics should we use to determine the relative effectiveness of various policies?  These are the sorts of questions we will ask in this course.  We will look at climate change and other pollution control policies.  We will also look specifically at the metrics used to determine whether various forms of governance are effective, including life-cycle analysis, carbon footprint calculations, ranking procedures, etc.. Student groups will work collaboratively to complete a set of wiki-based labs that introduce students to these methods. Based on what they learn, students will write a research paper covering a current topic in the public debate about various forms of energy and environmental governance - including market-based, government and consumer-based and social movement centered options - to deal with our current sustainability challenges.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-331 Elective Seminar: Spies! The Politics of Intelligence</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. In this course students will be introduced to recent issues concerning intelligence, such as intelligence failure, reform, and oversight, focusing particularly on how the change in US intelligence in the post-9/11 context has increasingly emphasized domestic - or "homeland" - intelligence. Students will gain a working understanding of the different types of intelligence, the range of responsibilities that the different IC members hold, and the relationship between intelligence and the policy-making process. Beyond the technical aspects of the intelligence function, students will explore the political context that frames intelligence operations and learn how the three branches of government both collaborate and conflict to utilize this resource. They will learn how integral intelligence information is to high-level government decision-making and the function of foreign policy. Finally, students will consider some of the major normative questions regarding intelligence, such as: what the appropriate role for intelligence should be in a democracy, how transparent intelligence should be to the public, and how its vast array of activities should be supervised.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-332 Elective Seminar: The Theater of Politics</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. Over the years, this course has canvassed the Washington theater scene and discovered a wealth of politically and socially attuned material on DC stages. Washington has, rather surprisingly, emerged as the second most vibrant theatrical city in the nation, surpassing Chicago and Los Angeles in number of performances offered, audience in attendance, and union actors appearing in Equity-contracted productions. The city now boasts some of the finest classical flagship and culturally specific theaters in the country. This advent of a robust theater scene planted in the seat of power has created a unique cultural profile; that of an artistic force able to speak truth to power. Yet oftentimes, theatrical institutions are constricted by the divided nature of the audience they play for, or the critical community that critiques them, or differing notions about the purpose of theater. What kind of portraits are emerging from area theaters in this politicized capital? What are the practical politics within these institutions that seek to engage and entertain their patrons? In addition to introducing students of the wonders of consistent theater-going with dynamic post-performance discussions with the artists who make the art, our focus will concern politically oriented works.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">66-334 Elective Seminar: Campaigns and Elections</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. This class will teach you how to better understand the fundamental factors that drive elections in America and to learn some of the skills employed by political professionals.  Many of your assignments will require you to apply the lessons of this class to real time events.  Pundits and other observers have already generated a phenomenal amount of analysis and commentary about the 2012 election - and occasionally they have even been right.  The goal in this class is to go beyond the spin and hyperbole of many election commentators and understand how voters decide and how strategists persuade.  And, to give you some of the technical skills to get an interesting job with a campaign. This class will combine the insights of campaign professionals with insight from the study of previous campaigns and core academic knowledge.  It will combine theory, practice, and exploration, taking the insights of political scientists and political practitioners and rolling them into one.<br />

<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br />NOTE: THIS COURSE IS FOR CMU WASHINGTON SEMESTER STUDENTS ONLY. What are the United States? interests in the Middle East? Who and what determine those interests? And how are those interests pursued? This course addresses these questions in two parts. First, we will consider the domestic American debate on foreign policy in the Middle East, exploring key Middle Eastern trends; America's regional interests; and the political actors and factors that shape U.S. policy in the Middle East. We will then turn to America?s actions and relationships in the region, assessing American policy dilemmas across a wide variety of countries and issues. Students should leave this class with a strong understanding of the challenges that the U.S. faces in the Middle East, as well as an informed viewpoint regarding how the U.S. should address those challenges.<br />

<dt class="keepwithnext">65-101 Humanities Scholar I</dt>
<dd>9 units<br />Fall 2013 --> HSP I, The Social Impact of War  Tim Haggerty (director, Humanities Scholars Program)    War is a continuing aspect of the human condition.  This course will introduce students to the manner in which war is conceptualized in modern societies, using readings from philosophy, literature, history and the social sciences to examine how warriors, belligerent societies and cultures describe the benefits and costs of war. The course will focus on the experience of war in the twentieth and twentieth-first century, from the Great War to the War on Terror, while also examining the Cold War and the antecedents to contemporary conflict.

This course is designed as a HSP III seminar in which we examine different views of what an event is, and how events are created and deployed in narrative.    Many disciplines in the humanities are involved with the theoretical grounds for providing an answer to this question: linguists study the relationship between the grammatican category of aspect and eventhood while philosophers propose various classifications of "actional types" in order to arrive at a taxonomy of occurrences.  Social  psychologists investigate how subjects segment a stream of activity and social historians grudgingly readmit events into the schemas of historiography (or decline to do so). All these scholars attempt to explain storytelling on a textual level as well as a higher-order cognitive and behavioral phenomenon.   The study of narratives highlights the role of events in representations of time, the construction of characters, and ultimately in readers' comprehension and interpretation. Building on rhetorical and linguistic theories of eventhood and narrative, this course develops a set of concepts and an analytic framework useful for investigating a variety of instances, from literary to personal texts, legal and political discourse, and most centrally historical accounts.<br />Prerequisite: 65-102.<br />

<dd>6 units<br />Sustainability is one of the greatest global predicaments now facing us. Symptoms abound: climate change, depletion of water resources, deforestation, pollution, and on and on. There are no easy answers to these problems. Even framing the relevant questions is difficult. Choosing between competing alternatives runs the risk of addressing one problem at the expense of another. Only through thoughtful and careful analysis can informed, robust and helpful strategies be developed.    Massive amounts of data are now available in a range of domains, e.g., telemetry, energy consumption, traffic patterns, healthcare etc. As a new resource, 'Big Data' is differentiated from traditional data by its volume, velocity, and variety. The dual combination of Big Data and technological advances in the general field of analytics and data mining currently provide an opportunity to potentially answer heretofore inaccessible questions. In the domain of sustainability, advances in sensor technology, metrology, physics based modeling, epidemiology, and ecological sciences provide an explosion of data yet to be mined. Relationships among these apparently disparate data sources have yet to be established and leveraged.    In this introductory course, students will gain exposure to sustainability. We will then examine some classical analytic techniques and their limitations for the nature of problems related to sustainability. We will tie these two themes of the course together by exploring contemporary Big Data approaches to the intractable problems of sustainability.    Units include: 1.Background on the problem domain (Sustainability); 2.Overview of classical Data Analytics and their limitations; 3.

 <h6>Note on Course Numbers</h6> <p>Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix which designates the department offering the course (76-xxx courses are offered by the Department of English, etc.). Although each department maintains its own course numbering practices, typically the first digit after the prefix indicates the class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore level, etc. xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or graduate-level, depending on the department. xx-7xx courses and higher are graduate-level.

<dt class="keepwithnext">73-100 Principles of Economics</dt>
<dd>All Semesters: 9 units<br />Literally, an introduction to economic principles, the goal of this course is to give students an understanding as to what constitutes good "economic thinking".  This thought process is grounded in the construction and use of economics models.  Drawing on issues in both microeconomics and macroeconomics, fundamental principles are shown to transcend  particular examples and allow the field to be seen as a coherent, unified whole.  (Lecture, 2 hours; Recitation, 1 hour).<br />

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />A course for non-majors which explores the interplay between economics and environmental issues.  Topics include: market failures and environmental problems, economically efficient allocations of environmental resources, and the intended and unintended consequences of public policies designed to improve the environment.  Practical issues surrounding the feasibility of implementing theoretically efficient principles and policies are analyzed, and alternative policies that might achieve better results in practice are investigated.

</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">73-155 Legonomics: Building Blocks of Economic Analysis</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />The overall theme of the course is how to use data and measurement to form models for economic analysis, with the emphasis not on any kind of formal statistical or econometric analysis, but rather on how to do the inductive science of translating perceived patterns in data into a usable model in the sense of ignoring noise and abstracting from patterns to hypothesize relationships.  We will work with historical data sets to "discover" Malthusian economics and model economic relationships that governed the human condition up until the mid-1700's.  We will then move on to the industrial revolution and "discover" the role of technology, culminating in an overview of modern thinking about economic growth.  Questions we will consider as well as looking at looking at the current public policy responses to them are:  Why are some countries rich and some are poor?  Why have some countries experienced rapid economic development; what can be done to foster development of others that continue to languish?  Does education lead to increased household wealth and national wealth?  How are new technologies affecting economic development and economic opportunities?  Can we improve design of electronic markets to take advantage of the vast opportunities for trade and exchange afforded by by the internet?

<dt class="keepwithnext">73-331 Political Economy of Inequality and Redistribution</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Three basic types of institution - markets, communities, and states (i.e. public governments) - determine the distribution of economic resources and opportunities in societies. The balance between these governing institutions has changed dramatically over time, at very different rates across societies. This course will begin with economic and political theory on why these differences over time and across countries may exist. Then it will survey some of these differences across both industrialized and pre-industrial societies and investigate their causes and consequences.   Some of the questions the course will ask include the following: In the industrialized world, the public sector (government) plays a much larger role in Europe than in the United States. Why is this so? How does this affect the quality of everyday life for different classes of people? How have globalization and technological change affected the distribution of income and social policy in industrialized countries, and how does this affect the public sector? In some tribal societies, people have no access to markets at all. How does this affect distributive behavior within communities? Finally, what might be the ultimate causes of income inequality on a global scale? Are there prehistoric and environmental roots in the ways peoples of different societies live today?

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This course provides an in-depth examination of the causes of financial crises as well as what governments can do to prevent them or at least reduce their cost. The course is designed to to provide an understanding of individual attitudes towards risk and individual decision making about savings and investment under uncertainty, and to use this understanding to evaluate the various economic roles played by financial institutions in helping individuals manage risk, especially those roles which may lead to economic instability and crises. In addition, the course may cover bubbles and swindles, especially when these spillover to the broader macroeconomy; the role of information in banking in normal times and in bank runs; crisis resolution techniques; and the extensive history of attempts to improve regulation so as to reduce the frequency and cost of crises.<br />Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=21-112" title="21-112" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-112');">21-112</a> or <a href="/search/?P=21-120" title="21-120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-120');">21-120</a>) and (<a href="/search/?P=21-256" title="21-256" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-256');">21-256</a> or <a href="/search/?P=21-259" title="21-259" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-259');">21-259</a> or <a href="/search/?P=21-268" title="21-268" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-268');">21-268</a> or <a href="/search/?P=21-269" title="21-269" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-269');">21-269</a>) and <a href="/search/?P=73-100" title="73-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-100');">73-100</a> and <a href="/search/?P=73-230" title="73-230" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-230');">73-230</a> and <a href="/search/?P=73-240" title="73-240" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-240');">73-240</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">73-432 Economics of Education</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />In this course we examine economic issues related to education, particularly at the elementary and secondary level. In exploring why we care about education, we examine the private returns to education (those that accrue to the individual) and the social returns (those that accrue to society), and how social returns provide one rationalization for government's involvement in education. After an overview of basic facts related to the provision of elementary and secondary education in the United States, we turn to the issue of how education is produced. We study the role of financial resources, teachers and peers in the production process, and examine evidence on the effectiveness of public vs. private schools. In the face of evidence that public schools in the United States do not fare well in international comparisons, one response has been to give parents greater choice of schools for their children. This leads us to study the most prevalent school choice mechanism (choosing where to live), as well as charter schools and private school vouchers. Another response has been the movement to hold public schools accountable, of which the No Child Left Behind legislation is an example. Thus, we examine issues on accountability theory and practice. The concern remains, however, that even if elementary and secondary education were significantly improved through various mechanisms, the cognitive ability of some children would already lag behind by the time they start school due to their early childhood experiences. In this spirit we analyze evidence on early childhood interventions for disadvantaged children. Building on our understanding of educational outcomes through high school, we finalize with an overview of the market for higher education, with an emphasis on college pricing and admission decisions. Throughout we use microeconomic analytical tools, and we examine empirical evidence that applies econometric techniques.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=21-120" title="21-120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-120');">21-120</a> and <a href="/search/?P=21-256" title="21-256" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-256');">21-256</a> and (<a href="/search/?P=36-226" title="36-226" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-226');">36-226</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-303" title="36-303" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-303');">36-303</a> or <a href="/search/?P=73-363" title="73-363" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-363');">73-363</a> or <a href="/search/?P=73-407" title="73-407" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-407');">73-407</a>) and <a href="/search/?P=73-100" title="73-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-100');">73-100</a> and <a href="/search/?P=73-230" title="73-230" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-230');">73-230</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://tepper.cmu.edu/undergraduate-economics/academics/course-list/index.aspx" target="_blank">http://tepper.cmu.edu/undergraduate-economics/academics/course-list/index.aspx</a></dd>

We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure.

<dt class="keepwithnext">73-465 Technology Strategy</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This course is about business strategy for technology-intensive industries.   Examples of such industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce. We will explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances. You will learn to analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; managing product complements; exploiting network effects; managing platform competition.  This course will help you understand the unique economic characteristics seen in today's technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies. In order to understand how firms strategically interact with consumers in technology-intensive industries this course will use a combination of simple but rigorous analytical models, emerging theories, and formal case studies.  (Lecture, 3 hours).

<dt class="keepwithnext">73-469 Global Electronic Markets: Economics and the Internet</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The information revolution brought about by the Internet is having a dramatic impact on the organization of economic activity. Long-term contractual relationships that once governed corporate procurement are being dismantled as manufacturers use the Internet to market directly to the public. New transportation networks that used to simply move goods from point A to point B are evolving into dynamic inventory pipelines that allow manufacturers to track and even reroute shipments in real time. At the same time, individuals are making use of sophisticated search engines to comparison shop at a scale that would have been physically exhausting even five years ago. In the Economics of E-commerce, we will use the basic tools of economic analysis to understand how and why the changes in information technology are reshaping the economic landscape.

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />The study of economic history provides important perspective on current economic institutions and policies.

The study of economic history provides an opportunity to test currently fashionable theories against data different from those used in their construction. In fact, this is a course in applied economics.

<dt class="keepwithnext">15-150 Principles of Functional Programming</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 10 units<br />An introduction to programming based on a "functional" model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs&#8212;-that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

<dd>Fall and Spring: 12 units<br />Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and "team programming" skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.

In a standard algorithms course, one concentrates on giving resource efficient methods to solve interesting problems. In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.  We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, #P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven!) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources, we limit our computational power.<br />Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=15-251" title="15-251" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-251');">15-251</a></dd>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br />Computing has changed beyond recognition in half a century, from the room-filling mainframes of the 1960s to today's smartphones and wearable devices.  Networks have also changed dramatically: from the 300-baud dialup modems of the early networking era to gigabit LANs, Wi-Fi and 4G today.    Who knows what changes are in store for us over the next half century?  Astonishingly, in spite of this tremendous change in hardware technology over time,  a small core set of techniques for building distributed systems has emerged and remained surprisingly stable and applicable across many system layers.    Many flavors of these  techniques exist, and they continously evolve over time to reflect changing trade-offs in the design space.  What are these core techniques, and how can we leverage them in creating distributed systems today and in the future?     That is the central question addressed by this course.  Students will acquire the knowledge base, intellectual tools, hands-on skills and modes of thought needed to build well-engineered distributed systems that withstand the test of time, growth in scale, and stresses of live use.

The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them.  To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong.  The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations.  This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking and managing impressions.  Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work.  Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures.  Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks.

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />So you want to do a startup and you know that you need funding. There are multiple ways to fund a new venture: bootstrapping, economic development, angels, venture capitalists. The question is what are these funders looking for in an early stage investment? What is important to them? How do they decide which companies to invest in and which not? This class looks at funding from the funder's point of view and provides the student with a framework of the investment process: investment criteria, sourcing, selection, due diligence, deal structure, valuation, post investment involvement. Real companies seeking funding are used for the final project in which students will be expected, as investment teams, to make investment decisions and convince their fellow investors (the class) to join them (or not).   This is a highly interactive and project class. There will be multiple guest speakers.   Prerequisites: Students are highly encouraged to take any of the introductory entrepreneurship classes offered in various schools and departments.

<dt class="keepwithnext">73-100 Principles of Economics</dt>
<dd>All Semesters: 9 units<br />Literally, an introduction to economic principles, the goal of this course is to give students an understanding as to what constitutes good "economic thinking".  This thought process is grounded in the construction and use of economics models.  Drawing on issues in both microeconomics and macroeconomics, fundamental principles are shown to transcend  particular examples and allow the field to be seen as a coherent, unified whole.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />A course for non-majors which explores the interplay between economics and environmental issues.  Topics include: market failures and environmental problems, economically efficient allocations of environmental resources, and the intended and unintended consequences of public policies designed to improve the environment.  Practical issues surrounding the feasibility of implementing theoretically efficient principles and policies are analyzed, and alternative policies that might achieve better results in practice are investigated.

</dl><dl class="courseblock">
<dt class="keepwithnext">73-155 Legonomics: Building Blocks of Economic Analysis</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />The overall theme of the course is how to use data and measurement to form models for economic analysis, with the emphasis not on any kind of formal statistical or econometric analysis, but rather on how to do the inductive science of translating perceived patterns in data into a usable model in the sense of ignoring noise and abstracting from patterns to hypothesize relationships.  We will work with historical data sets to "discover" Malthusian economics and model economic relationships that governed the human condition up until the mid-1700's.  We will then move on to the industrial revolution and "discover" the role of technology, culminating in an overview of modern thinking about economic growth.  Questions we will consider as well as looking at looking at the current public policy responses to them are:  Why are some countries rich and some are poor?  Why have some countries experienced rapid economic development; what can be done to foster development of others that continue to languish?  Does education lead to increased household wealth and national wealth?  How are new technologies affecting economic development and economic opportunities?  Can we improve design of electronic markets to take advantage of the vast opportunities for trade and exchange afforded by by the internet?

<dt class="keepwithnext">73-331 Political Economy of Inequality and Redistribution</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br />Three basic types of institution - markets, communities, and states (i.e. public governments) - determine the distribution of economic resources and opportunities in societies. The balance between these governing institutions has changed dramatically over time, at very different rates across societies. This course will begin with economic and political theory on why these differences over time and across countries may exist. Then it will survey some of these differences across both industrialized and pre-industrial societies and investigate their causes and consequences.   Some of the questions the course will ask include the following: In the industrialized world, the public sector (government) plays a much larger role in Europe than in the United States. Why is this so? How does this affect the quality of everyday life for different classes of people? How have globalization and technological change affected the distribution of income and social policy in industrialized countries, and how does this affect the public sector? In some tribal societies, people have no access to markets at all. How does this affect distributive behavior within communities? Finally, what might be the ultimate causes of income inequality on a global scale? Are there prehistoric and environmental roots in the ways peoples of different societies live today? This course will examine these questions by studying theoretical and empirical research conducted by economists, economic anthropologists, political economists, and economic geographers on these questions.

After an overview of basic facts related to the provision of elementary and secondary education in the United States, we turn to the issue of how education is produced. We study the role of financial resources, teachers and peers in the production process, and examine evidence on the effectiveness of public vs. private schools. In the face of evidence that public schools in the United States do not fare well in international comparisons, one response has been to give parents greater choice of schools for their children. This leads us to study the most prevalent school choice mechanism (choosing where to live), as well as charter schools and private school vouchers. Another response has been the movement to hold public schools accountable, of which the No Child Left Behind legislation is an example. Thus, we examine issues on accountability theory and practice. The concern remains, however, that even if elementary and secondary education were significantly improved through various mechanisms, the cognitive ability of some children would already lag behind by the time they start school due to their early childhood experiences. In this spirit we analyze evidence on early childhood interventions for disadvantaged children. Building on our understanding of educational outcomes through high school, we finalize with an overview of the market for higher education, with an emphasis on college pricing and admission decisions. Throughout we use microeconomic analytical tools, and we examine empirical evidence that applies econometric techniques.<br />Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=21-120" title="21-120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-120');">21-120</a> and <a href="/search/?P=21-256" title="21-256" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-256');">21-256</a> and (<a href="/search/?P=36-226" title="36-226" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-226');">36-226</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-303" title="36-303" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-303');">36-303</a> or <a href="/search/?P=73-363" title="73-363" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-363');">73-363</a> or <a href="/search/?P=73-407" title="73-407" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-407');">73-407</a>) and <a href="/search/?P=73-100" title="73-100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-100');">73-100</a> and <a href="/search/?P=73-230" title="73-230" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-230');">73-230</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://tepper.cmu.edu/undergraduate-economics/academics/course-list/index.aspx" target="_blank">http://tepper.cmu.edu/undergraduate-economics/academics/course-list/index.aspx</a></dd>

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This course explores the problems of earth, air, and water pollution from an economic perspective with an emphasis on analyzing the effects of environmental policies. It is designed to help students understand real world policy questions and issues with both intermediate microeconomic concepts and econometric tools. This course is divided into two parts. Part 1 provides an overview of microeconomic principles and models that are particularly relevant to thinking about environmental policies, such as the U.S. Acid Rain Program. Part 2 provides econometric tools to estimate the costs and the benefits of environmental policies. (Lecture, 3 hours).

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />Interaction is a fundamental part of social science: firms market products to consumers, people share opinions and information with their friends, workers collaborate on projects, agents form alliances and coalitions. In this course, we will use the emerging field of social networks to put structure on this diverse mass of connections. Using a mixture of theoretical, empirical, and computational methods, we will learn about the structure and function of social networks. We will look at how an individual's position in a social network reflects her role in the community. We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure. The material in this course will be interdisciplinary, drawn from the fields of math, computer science, physics, sociology, political science, and economics. By the end of the course, you will have the tools and knowledge needed to analyze social networks on your own. The course is capped with a project where you will use your skills to answer your own questions.<br />Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=36-202" title="36-202" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-202');">36-202</a> or <a href="/search/?P=70-207" title="70-207" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '70-207');">70-207</a>) and <a href="/search/?P=73-230" title="73-230" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '73-230');">73-230</a></dd>

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br />This course is about business strategy for technology-intensive industries.   Examples of such industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce. We will explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances. You will learn to analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; managing product complements; exploiting network effects; managing platform competition.  This course will help you understand the unique economic characteristics seen in today's technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies. In order to understand how firms strategically interact with consumers in technology-intensive industries this course will use a combination of simple but rigorous analytical models, emerging theories, and formal case studies.

<dd>Fall: 9 units<br />The information revolution brought about by the Internet is having a dramatic impact on the organization of economic activity. Long-term contractual relationships that once governed corporate procurement are being dismantled as manufacturers use the Internet to market directly to the public. New transportation networks that used to simply move goods from point A to point B are evolving into dynamic inventory pipelines that allow manufacturers to track and even reroute shipments in real time. At the same time, individuals are making use of sophisticated search engines to comparison shop at a scale that would have been physically exhausting even five years ago.
